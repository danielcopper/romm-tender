"""SQLite adapter for the ``CollectionSyncState`` aggregate over ``collection_sync_state``.

One row per synced standard/smart collection, keyed by the composite
``(collection_id, collection_kind)`` — the per-collection completion stamp the
incremental-skip gate reads (ADR-0023, the collection sibling of
``platform_sync_state``). A leaf table with no cascade children, so ``save``
upserts with ``INSERT OR REPLACE``, ``delete`` drops one collection's row (local
destructive flows that intersect a removed ROM), ``iter_all`` scans every stamp
(so a removal can find the ones whose member set contains a removed ROM), and
``clear`` drops the whole table (Force Full Sync). ``member_rom_ids`` is stored
as a JSON array TEXT and decoded back to a tuple.
