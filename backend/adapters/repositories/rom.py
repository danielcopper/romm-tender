# deliberately NOT here — they are per-game deviations, not synced identity:
# each is read in SELECT but written only via its own set_*() method, never by
# save(), so a re-sync (which builds a fresh Rom with both = None) cannot wipe a
# user's pin. The version-metadata columns (sibling_group_key + the version
# dimensions) ARE here — they are server-derived facts that must refresh on
# every sync (ADR-0021), the opposite of the user pins. cover_source (the
# cover-cache fingerprint, #1386) rides the UPSERT like cover_path: the commit
# writes the value the artwork layer confirmed this run, else the preserved
# existing one — the merge happens on the Rom before save(), not here.
