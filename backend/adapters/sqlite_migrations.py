"""SQLite schema migration runner — applies numbered DDL to the plugin database.

Anything that creates the SQLite database or advances its schema at startup
belongs here. The runner discovers ``NNN_*.sql`` files under ``db/migrations/``
beside this package, applies the ones newer than the database's
recorded version, and stamps the new version into ``PRAGMA user_version``.

stdlib ``sqlite3`` only — no third-party migration tooling. The
Repository/Unit-of-Work layer that reads the database, and the full
per-connection runtime PRAGMA set, live elsewhere (#783); this module owns
only schema creation and version advancement.

    """Apply every pending migration to the SQLite database at ``db_path``.

    Discovers ``NNN_*.sql`` files under ``migrations_dir``, orders them by
    the leading integer, and applies only those whose number is greater than
    the database's current ``PRAGMA user_version``. Each migration runs in
    its own ``BEGIN`` / DDL / version-bump / ``COMMIT`` transaction: on
    failure the transaction is rolled back (leaving the database at the last
    successfully-applied version) and the error re-raised. The database file
    and any missing parent directory are created on first run.

    Migration files must contain transaction-safe DDL only and must NOT carry
    their own ``BEGIN`` / ``COMMIT`` — the runner supplies the transaction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    db_path:
        Absolute path to the SQLite database file.
    migrations_dir:
        Directory holding the ``NNN_*.sql`` files. Defaults to the migrations
        shipped beside this adapter.
    logger:
        Logger for per-migration progress. Defaults to this module's logger.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The ``user_version`` after all pending migrations have been applied
        (unchanged when there is nothing pending).

    Raises
    ------
    sqlite3.Error
        If a migration fails; its transaction is rolled back before re-raising.
