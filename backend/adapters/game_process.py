"""Game-process adapter — concrete ``GameProcessControl`` over ``/proc``.

Owns the host-side view of what a flatpak app is running: the per-user flatpak
instance registry, the ``/proc`` process tree beneath each live instance, what
those processes were started with, and the signals sent to them. Direct file
reads and ``os.kill`` only — no ``subprocess``, no shelling out to
``flatpak kill``.

Why the host process table at all — Steam cannot terminate these games.
A RomM shortcut execs ``flatpak run <app>``; flatpak's D-Bus portal starts the
sandbox from the session helper, so the emulator is **not** a descendant of
Steam's ``reaper`` and ``SteamClient.Apps.TerminateApp`` has nothing to signal
(measured on-device: a proven no-op). The flatpak instance registry is the only
handle that survives that detach.

Every read is guarded and fail-soft, like ``renderer_rss``: a process or
instance directory that vanishes mid-scan is a normal race and is skipped, so
one dead pid never blanks the whole result. A pid that cannot be identified is
never signalled.
