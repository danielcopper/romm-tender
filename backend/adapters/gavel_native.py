"""Native gavel core adapter — the compiled save-sync decision kernels.

The single seam through which save-sync reaches the compiled
`romm-gavel <https://github.com/danielcopper/romm-gavel>`_ core for both of its
decisions: the full per-``(rom, filename, slot)`` sync action and the upload-409
resolution fallback. Owns the ``ctypes`` load of the vendored
``native/libgavel-x86_64-linux.so`` beside this package, and the FFI
marshalling around its C
ABI. The adapter is itself the callable implementing the
``ResolveUploadConflictFn`` Protocol, and its :meth:`compute_sync_action` bound
method implements ``ComputeSyncActionFn``, so services consume both decisions
without knowing a shared library is behind them.

Two conversions are the adapter's job rather than the core's, and both exist so
"unknown" survives the boundary as a flag instead of a value:

- **Timestamps.** The core takes epoch seconds plus a "known" companion flag;
  turning a server save's ISO-8601 ``updated_at`` into that pair happens here.
  What the *contract* says — an unparseable timestamp loses head selection and
  cannot prove local-newer — lives in the core, as its behavior when the flag is
  clear. A substitute instant would silently make that contract untestable.
- **Optional numbers.** An absent size becomes a clear ``has_*`` flag, never a
  sentinel value: 0 is exactly what the corrupt-local guard reacts to, so it
  cannot double as "no size recorded".

Presence of the local file is carried by the pointer alone (``NULL`` vs.
non-``NULL``), never by the ``has_*`` flags — a file that exists but could not be
measured is a real case the decision must keep apart from a missing one.

There is no fallback: if the library cannot load, :class:`GavelNativeLoadError`
propagates so bootstrap aborts and the plugin stays inert — the same
"fatal until the environment is fixed" posture as the SQLite migration gate.
Nothing in-tree stands in for the core; :mod:`domain.sync_action` holds only the
vocabulary the answer comes back in.
