        This function is purely the destructive switch:

        1. Download id=save_id content → overwrite local file.
           ``do_download_save`` updates ``tracked_save_id`` /

           ``save.updated_at`` to NOW (the ``onupdate=utc_now`` hook) and
           upserts our DeviceSaveSync row (``synced_at = updated_at``), so
           id=save_id is now newest in the slot and ``is_current`` already
           evaluates true for us.

           already upserted our sync row (RomM's PUT auto-upserts on every
           supported version), so this ack is at most a redundant idempotent
           re-write, not the required step it was once described as (#1458).
        4. ``do_upload_save`` refreshes local sync state via
           ``update_file_sync_state`` to match the post-PUT response.

        After this, the next ``compute_sync_action`` run picks id=save_id
        (now newest), our ``is_current=true``, hash matches →
        ``Skip(synced)``. Other devices on their next sync see id=save_id

        1. Run ``do_sync_rom_saves`` as a matrix pre-flight on the

           - ``Skip(synced)`` / ``Skip(adopt_baseline=True)`` — proceed.
           - ``Upload(POST/PUT)`` — silently push local up, then proceed.

           - ``Conflict`` — abort with ``conflict_blocked``; user must
             resolve via the standard ``SyncConflictModal`` first.

        2. After a clean pre-flight, the destructive switch runs in
           ``_rollback_to_version_io``: download chosen → write to
           canonical local target → PUT same content → ``confirm_download``.

        ``filename`` is kept in the signature for callable-wiring stability
        but no longer drives any decision — the canonical local path is
        derived from the target save and the ROM name.

        Returns a status dict:
        - ``{"status": "ok"}`` on success.
        - ``{"status": "rom_not_installed"}`` if the ROM is not installed
          locally. The frontend distinguishes this from
          ``version_deleted`` so it can prompt the user to reinstall the
          ROM rather than telling them the version is gone from the
          server.
        - ``{"status": "unsupported"}`` if the slot's current save spans
          more than one distinct file (e.g. Saturn ``.bkr``/``.bcr``/
          ``.smpc``). Per-version rollback would revert one component and
          leave the others — an incoherent save — so it is refused.
          Interim #908 guard; grouped atomic-set rollback is tracked there.
          The same status carries an additive
          ``"reason": "savefiles_in_content_dir"`` field when the refusal is
          instead because RetroArch writes saves to the content dir (#239):
          the rollback's ``saves_dir`` target is ignored by RetroArch, so the
          switch could never take effect. The frontend already hides the panel
          via ``get_save_status``'s ``rollback_supported=False``; the
          additive reason lets a direct caller distinguish the two causes.
        - ``{"status": "version_deleted"}`` if the chosen save id is no
          longer on the server (genuinely deleted — the ``list_saves``
          call succeeded and the id was absent).
        - ``{"status": "server_unreachable", "message": ...}`` if the
          post-preflight ``list_saves`` call failed (network, server,
          auth, etc.). The frontend distinguishes this from
          ``version_deleted`` so it can show a retry affordance instead
          of "version no longer on the server".
        - ``{"status": "not_found", "message": ...}`` if that same call drew
          a definitive 404 — RomM no longer has this ROM or the registered
          device id. Distinct from both siblings: ``version_deleted`` is one
          missing save inside a ROM the server still has, and
          ``server_unreachable`` is a connection the user can retry (#1570).
        - ``{"status": "conflict_blocked", "conflicts": [...]}`` if the
          pre-flight surfaced a conflict on the currently-tracked save.
          The frontend resolves it via the standard conflict modal.
        - ``{"status": "preflight_failed", "errors": [...]}`` if the
          pre-flight hit non-conflict errors (network, server, etc.).
          No switch was attempted.
        - ``{"status": "put_failed", "message": ...}`` if the local
          download succeeded but the server-side ``updated_at`` bump
          failed. Local file and state already point at the target;
          retrying is safe and idempotent. Without a successful re-PUT
