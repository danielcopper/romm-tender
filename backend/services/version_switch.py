"""VersionSwitchService — the version picker's read + write callables (ADR-0021).

Owns the two frontend callables behind the game-detail version picker.
``get_version_list`` reports every version of a sibling group — the local rows
(rich version dimensions) merged with the server's live ``sibling_roms`` view
(slim stubs for versions not yet synced) — with the active / downloaded / default
markers the picker paints. Retained local rows are checked for ephemeral liveness
on each read; only an exact-ROM 404 marks one vanished. ``switch_version`` moves
the group's Steam-shortcut binding to a chosen sibling (the active version),
rechecking a local target's exact-id liveness immediately before the write and
persisting a server-only target first when needed.

A version switch is a pure binding move: the shortcut's name and appId stay
sticky (ADR-0021 §2) and no save state migrates (ADR-0021 §4). Switching a
*downloaded* game keeps its existing files in place — the switch never deletes
or transfers saves — but a switch *away* from a downloaded version whose local
saves drift from their sync baseline is soft-blocked so the user can sync first
(#1298); an explicit ``allow_stranded`` override honours "switch anyway". A
switch back onto a still-installed version re-bakes that install's full Steam
``launch_options`` (the frontend writes it onto the shortcut); switching to an
uninstalled version returns the empty placeholder (ADR-0009). The group is
resolved by ``sibling_group_key`` over the migration-010 index; the server view
comes from ``get_rom(bound).sibling_roms``. Server I/O and the relaunch resolver
run outside the Unit of Work (ADR-0006) — read/close, then fetch/resolve, then a
short write UoW. The liveness request narrows the race but cannot transact with
RomM and SQLite as one unit.

        representative. Switching away from a *downloaded* version whose local

        probe), ``unsynced_rom_id``, and ``unsynced_version_name`` so the frontend

        ``allow_stranded`` is the "Switch anyway" override for the save-stranding
