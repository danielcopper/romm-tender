"""One work unit's covers, made ready before its shortcuts are emitted.

The **apply path's** cover work for one unit: the invalidation pass that
re-downloads the covers whose server source changed, the download for the
shortcuts the unit is about to emit, and the ``cover_path`` each emitted entry
carries to the frontend. Artwork itself — the per-ROM cover cache, the grid
publish, the conditional revalidation, every byte read or written — belongs to
:class:`~services.artwork.ArtworkService` behind the ``ArtworkManager`` seam,
and stays there: this module supplies what only a run knows (which ROMs a unit
is emitting a shortcut for, where the unit sits in the progress bar, and whether
the run is cancelling) and reads back what only the commit needs (the confirmed
cover fingerprints).

**This is not the run's only artwork holder.** :class:`~services.library.
reporter.SyncReporter` holds the same seam for a different question — turning a
staged cover path into the published grid name at each chunk's commit
(``finalize_cover_path``) — so the package's ``artwork`` confinement names two
owners, and ``scripts/check_seam_owner.py`` enforces exactly that pair. What the
cut settled is narrower and complete: :class:`~services.library.
sync_orchestrator.SyncOrchestrator` holds no ``ArtworkManager`` at all.

**The direction of that split is the reason this is not part of the artwork
service.** The delta vocabulary a cover decision is made in here —
``BIND_ROM_ID_KEY``, an emitted entry, a :class:`~domain.work_unit.WorkUnit` —
is the sync's, and the run signals bound into every call
(``emit_progress``, ``is_cancelling``) are held by the sync's own sub-services.
The artwork service takes both as parameters precisely because it owns neither,
and services do not import one another.

Nothing here opens a transaction or reaches the outside world: the fingerprints
this module returns are persisted by the unit's own commit, one layer up.
