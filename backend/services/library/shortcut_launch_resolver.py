"""Resolve each ROM's launch facts — which file is launched, and what runs it.

Answers the two questions :func:`domain.shortcut_data.build_shortcuts_data`
asks about every ROM it bakes into a Steam shortcut: the disc-resolved path of
the installed file (``{rom_id: bake_path}``) and the emulator that should run it
(``{rom_id: EmulatorInvocation}``). Both preview and the per-unit apply resolve
their maps here and hand them straight to the bake. Anything that is not a
launch fact of a single ROM belongs elsewhere: the shortcut's *shape* is the
domain builder's, and what the run does with the built shortcuts is
:class:`~services.library.sync_orchestrator.SyncOrchestrator`'s.

The install-path readers own their own read Unit of Work; the core resolution
opens none, because the injected ``active_core`` seam opens one per ROM.
**Those two must never share a transaction.** A Unit of Work takes SQLite's
non-reentrant ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``, so resolving a core inside an open UoW
blocks until ``busy_timeout`` and then raises ``database is locked`` — on a
real device only, since ``FakeUnitOfWork`` shares no connection and every test
stays green. Holding all three methods on one class is what makes folding the
path read and the core read into one pass a one-liner, and only half of that
one-liner is gated: ``scripts/check_uow_seam_nesting.py`` fires on the inline
form (naming ``active_emulator_for_rom`` inside the ``with`` block) and is
silent on the peer-call form (``self.do_build_core_overrides(...)`` inside it),
a blind spot its own docstring records. So the reason not to write the fold is
the deadlock, not a check that would stop you — nothing will.

The ``disc_resolver`` seam is held to the same boundary from the other side:
both install-path readers snapshot their ``(install, selected_disc)`` pairs
inside the read UoW and close it before resolving a single one, because
``resolve_for_install`` lists the install directory. CONTEXT.md's Unit of Work
entry keeps a transaction to database reads and writes — ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``
takes the write lock even for a read, so a directory walk per installed ROM
held inside one stalls every other writer for as long as the walk takes. The
same check carries this as its second rule, on the same matcher and with the
same reach: it fires on ``resolve_for_install`` named inside the ``with``
block and is silent on the peer-call form. Both boundaries are gated inline;
neither is gated against the fold.
