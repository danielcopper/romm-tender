"""Sync result reporter and registry-query sub-service.

Owns the post-apply path: the frontend-callable ``report_unit_results``
ack (event signal only) and the orchestrator-driven
``commit_unit_results`` that finalises artwork file names and upserts
each acked ROM into the ``roms`` aggregate, stamping its cached
``rom_metadata`` in the same write UoW (Rom row first, then metadata —
FK-safe). The terminal
``finalize_per_unit_run`` step builds the cross-unit collection
mappings, refreshes the ``platform_slug → display_name`` cache, and
emits the ``sync_complete`` event. Also owns the registry- and
run-history-derived query methods (``get_registry_platforms``,
``get_sync_stats``, ``get_sync_runs``, ``get_rom_by_steam_app_id``)
and the ``clear_sync_cache`` reset.
Anything that mutates the ``roms`` registry as a side-effect of a
finished sync run belongs here; anything that decides "what should
this sync do?" belongs in the orchestrator.

        Group-aware commit (ADR-0021): this chunk's slice of the live RomM fetch
        (*unit_roms*) is upserted — one ``roms`` row per sibling for its
        identity + version metadata — while only the acked representatives
        carry a Steam-shortcut binding. A non-representative sibling keeps
        whatever binding it already had (usually none); a bound row not
        re-acked this cycle is never silently unbound.

        The frontend ack is **translated through any rebind** first: a rebind
        entry is keyed by the vanished bound sibling (so the frontend reused its
        shortcut), but the binding — and the finalised cover — move onto the
        surviving representative named in ``bind_rom_id``.

        ADR-0006 two-pass: cover-file RENAME is filesystem I/O so it runs FIRST
        (outside any UoW); the final paths are collected, then one short write
        UoW upserts every ROM (Rom row first, cached metadata second — FK-safe),
        so a ROM and its metadata land atomically.

        ``platform_stamp`` (set by :class:`ChunkDispatcher` on the final chunk of
        a platform unit, ADR-0023) is saved inside that same write UoW, so the
        per-platform completion stamp commits atomically with the chunk's rom
        upserts — the platform is stamped complete iff its last chunk is durable.
        ``collection_stamp`` is the collection sibling (#742), set on the final
        chunk of a standard/smart collection unit; it rides the same UoW so a
        collection is stamped complete iff its last chunk is durable. Exactly one
        of the two is ever set per commit (a unit is a platform or a collection).

        ``fetch_id`` is the fetch generation stamped onto every row this commit
        upserts (#1504). It is set on EVERY chunk of a platform unit — not just
        the final one — so the whole unit's rows share the generation its

        ``count`` is bound ROMs — how many Steam shortcuts exist, which is
        what the Remove group acts on. ``reachable_count`` is how many of
        the platform's ROMs a reader can get to through one of those
        shortcuts (:func:`_reachable_row_count`), which is what the header
        line states beside RomM's own total. Display names come from the
        ``platform_names`` cache refreshed each sync, degrading to the slug
        when a name is absent (RomM never seen for that slug).

        A platform with no bound row is omitted entirely, as it always has
        been. Nothing is lost with it: no group there holds a binding, so
        its ``reachable_count`` is 0 by construction, and the frontend
        reads an absent platform as zero on both counts.

        The incremental-skip gate (fetcher) is stamp-based: its sole skip
        authority is the per-platform ``PlatformSyncState`` completion stamp
        (ADR-0023) and the per-collection ``CollectionSyncState`` stamp (#742),
        each of which is its own ``effective_last_sync``. So the full re-fetch is
        armed by clearing every stamp — no platform or collection then holds skip
        authority and each full-fetches next time. The recorded
        ``applied_launch_options`` are reset to NULL in the same write UoW, so
        the delta apply (ADR-0025) skips nothing on that run: "force" also means
        force past the per-item skip — the one repair path for Steam-side drift
        the recorded value cannot see (a manually edited or corrupted shortcut).
        The re-apply re-records every value.

        The ``SyncRun`` history is deliberately **preserved**: it feeds no skip
        gate (the fetcher never reads it), and it is the source of the "Last
        sync" display — the newest completed run's ``last_sync`` plus the newest
        terminal run's last-attempt hint, both read by ``get_sync_stats``.
        Deleting it forced nothing and only blanked the display to "Never" right
        after a reset (#1318). Keeping it means a post-force preview shows
        collections/platforms as "unchanged" (they exist in Steam; membership
        did not change), which is correct.

        What the preserved history does **not** carry is a resumable run. This
        clear takes away BOTH kinds of skip authority — every completion stamp and
        every recorded launch command — and the panel's resume offer reads those,
        never the history, so there is nothing left to continue here. That the two
        are cleared together is what makes the offer's rule hold; see

        ``last_sync`` is the ``finished_at`` of the latest completed ``SyncRun``;
        ``last_attempt`` surfaces the newest cancelled/interrupted/paused/errored run when
        it is newer than that (see :meth:`_last_attempt`); the ROM count is the
        bound-shortcut count in ``roms``.

        The last two are what makes the panel's resume offer honest, and
        they are two facts rather than one because this plugin keeps **two** kinds
        of durable progress. A **completion stamp** makes the next run pass over a
        whole platform or collection at fetch time; a **recorded launch command**
        makes it pass over one game at apply time. Both survive a stopped run and
        both are cleared together by Force Full Sync, which is the entire #1789
        defect: the offer used to be derived from the run history, which Force
        Full Sync deliberately preserves (#1318), so it outlived the progress it
        promised to continue.

        Neither fact subsumes the other, so the offer reads both. A run cancelled
        inside its very first platform unit has written shortcuts and recorded
        their launch commands but reached no final chunk, so it holds recorded
        games and no stamp — and it is a genuine resume, because the next run
        really does less work. In the other direction, a row predating migration
        015 carries a NULL recorded value while its platform's stamp survives, so
        an upgraded install can hold stamps with zero recorded games and still
        skip those platforms wholesale. Counting only one kind declares one of
        these two a fresh start when it is not.

        Everything here rides in the read UoW that already scans ``roms``: the
        recorded-game count is one more condition inside that same loop (``iter_all``
        already selects ``applied_launch_options``), and each stamp probe is a
        ``SELECT 1 … LIMIT 1`` over a leaf table. The panel mount pays nothing
