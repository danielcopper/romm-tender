"""SessionLifecycleService — single-callable end-of-session orchestration.

Composes the four cross-service reads the frontend's game-stop handler
used to interleave into one round-trip: end-of-session playtime
record, fire-and-forget achievement refresh, post-exit save sync, and
the migration-state refresh. Returns a typed ``SessionFinalizeResult``
carrying the playtime delta plus the per-direction transfer counts and
the migration-status payloads the frontend feeds into its in-memory
stores. The playtime-display update (Steam's ``appStore`` mutation)
stays on the frontend because it touches Steam IPC; everything else
about the end-of-session flow is now a backend decision.

Save-sync completion copy is split by kind: the directional success
toast is presentation the frontend renders from the counts (via the
shared ``saveSyncToastBody`` helper, the single source of that copy and
i18n-ready), while the offline/failure body (``failure_toast``) follows
the backend-owned message convention.
