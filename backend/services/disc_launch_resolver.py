"""DiscLaunchResolver — the single read-path disc-resolution seam per ROM.

The one place that answers "which file will this multi-disc ROM actually launch
with?", folding the user's persisted ``roms.selected_disc`` pick over the live
enumeration of disc images in the ROM's install directory. Every launch-bake
site draws the bake path from this seam so the baked launch_options never
diverge from the picker's current selection, and the picker callables enumerate
through the same seam so the list they show is the list the bake resolves over.

Resolution is a bake-time path-override layer only: it returns the path to bake
into the Steam shortcut's launch_options, it never rewrites the install's
``file_path`` (save-path / core / displayed-filename derivations stay stable),
mirroring how :class:`ActiveCoreResolver` overrides the invocation without
touching ``file_path``. A non-multi-disc ROM (single-file install, or a folder
with fewer than two disc images) resolves to its own ``file_path`` unchanged —
zero behavior change. A stale pin (the selected disc is no longer present)
degrades to the default with a WARNING, never fatal, mirroring
``ActiveCoreResolver``'s stale-label handling. See ADR-0014.

        every launch-bake site already draws its path from here, and

        A final folder-boot override layer (``folder_boot_root``) then bakes the

        the nested launch file (PS3/RPCS3 — ``…/PS3_GAME/USRDIR/EBOOT.BIN`` →
        ``…``, ADR-0019). It only fires when the resolved path still carries a
