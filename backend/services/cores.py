"""CoreService — RetroArch core selection and overrides per platform/ROM.

Owns the plugin's two core-selection deviations: the per-platform core (the
``settings.json`` ``platform_cores`` map) and the per-game emulator override (the
``roms.emulator_override`` pin). Enumerating the cores available for a platform —
by slug, or for a ROM with its per-game pin layered on top — toggling the
per-platform default (with the fan-out that re-bakes every affected shortcut),
and pinning/clearing a per-game core all live here; the
cross-service BIOS recheck that follows a per-platform core write is also
scheduled from this service.

Neither selection is written to the retired ES-DE gamelist: the per-platform core
lands in ``settings.json`` via the injected ``SettingsPersister`` and the per-game
pin lands on the ``Rom`` aggregate via the Unit-of-Work. The launch command for an
installed+bound ROM is recomputed from the shared ``ActiveCoreReader`` resolver so
the read-path core never diverges from the launched core, and the frontend can
confirm-set the freshly-baked ``launch_options`` on the live Steam shortcut.

        ``active_core`` and ``active_core_label`` are two projections of that ONE

        emulator alone (pinning the same emulator as the per-platform override is

        """Bake the launch command for *rom* with *emulator*, or ``(None, None)``.

        Takes the ROM's ``RomInstall`` snapshot directly (``None`` when
        uninstalled) so the bake runs with no open Unit of Work — the callers
        snapshot the install inside their write UoW and close it before baking,
        since the shared active-core resolver opens its own UoW and the
        per-connection ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` write lock is not re-entrant.

        An installed (``RomInstall`` with a ``file_path``) **and** bound
        (``shortcut_app_id`` set) ROM gets the full launch command — the ``-e``
        form when *emulator* is set (libretro core or standalone), the plain form
        when it is ``None`` — over the disc-resolved bake path (the ROM's persisted
        ``selected_disc`` for a multi-disc ROM, its ``file_path`` unchanged for a
        single-disc ROM), paired with its Steam ``app_id``. An uninstalled or
        unbound ROM has no live shortcut to update, so both are ``None`` and the
        stored pin/clear applies on the next download/sync.
