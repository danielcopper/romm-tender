"""Repository Protocols — one per aggregate root in the SQLite persistence layer.

Services declare dependencies on these Protocols rather than on concrete SQLite
adapter classes. Adapters implement them; the composition root wires them. This
keeps the dependency direction clean (adapters → Protocols, never services →
adapters) and makes each repository swappable in tests with a fake.

One Repository per aggregate root, not per table. ``RomSaveSyncStateRepository``
spans two tables (``rom_save_sync_states`` + ``rom_save_files``); that is an adapter
concern — services see a single aggregate.

The Protocols match the aggregate roots settled in ADR-0003 — ``Rom``,
``RomInstall``, ``RomMetadata``, ``Playtime``, ``RomSaveSyncState``, ``BiosFile``,
``FirmwareCacheEntry``, ``SyncRun`` — plus ``PlatformSyncState`` (the per-platform
completion stamp, ADR-0023) and the ``kv_config`` key-value surface.
``SyncSettings``/``Platform``/``Device`` are NOT repositories — ADR-0003 dropped
those aggregates.

Repository methods take no database connection parameter. The Unit-of-Work layer
(#783) injects connections into concrete adapter constructors; services see only
this Protocol surface.
