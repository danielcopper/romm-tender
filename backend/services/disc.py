"""DiscService — the multi-disc picker's read + write callables.

Owns the two frontend callables behind the disc picker: ``get_disc_selection``
reports whether a ROM is multi-disc and, if so, the launchable discs plus the
current and default targets; ``select_disc`` pins a disc (or clears the pin back
to the default) and returns the freshly-baked launch command for the frontend to
confirm-set on the live Steam shortcut.

The disc pick lands on the ``Rom`` aggregate via the Unit-of-Work (the pin-only
``set_selected_disc`` write path, never the sync UPSERT), mirroring how the
per-game emulator override is written in :class:`CoreService`. Enumeration and
launch-path resolution both go through the shared :class:`DiscLaunchResolver`
seam so the list the picker shows is the list the bake resolves over, and the
baked launch command never diverges from the picker's selection. The picker only
ever applies to a folder-backed (multi-file) install — a single-file ROM owns no
disc folder and reports ``multi_disc: False``.
