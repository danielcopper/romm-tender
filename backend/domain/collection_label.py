"""Fine display label for a RomM collection, keyed by kind + virtual type.

The pure kernel behind the ``by_label`` Steam-collection naming mode: it maps a
collection's ``kind`` (``standard`` / ``smart`` / ``virtual``) and, for the
virtual kind, its ``virtual_type`` (``franchise`` / ``collection``) onto the
short human label the reporter appends to a collection name so same-named
collections of different types stay separate Steam collections
(``RomM: [<name> (Franchise)] (host)``). No I/O, no state.

The label strings MUST match the frontend vocabulary exactly — ``SUB_TAB_LABELS``
and ``VIRTUAL_TYPE_LABELS`` in ``frontend/src/bigpicture/LibraryPage.tsx`` — so
the type a user sees on the Collections page is the type baked into the Steam
name. Keep the two in sync.

Label-format safety: a label is appended inside the single bracket pair of
``RomM: [<name> (<label>)]``, and the frontend reconcile parses that name with
``/^RomM: \\[([^\\]]+)\\]/`` (``frontend/src/index.tsx``). So a label must
contain **no** ``]`` character (parens are safe, brackets would truncate the
parsed name and orphan the collection). Every label below is bracket-free; the
fallback capitalises a controlled kind literal, which is too.
