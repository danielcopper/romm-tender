"""Per-ROM playtime — running totals, the in-flight session marker, and the outbox.

One Playtime per Rom (referenced by id). Tracks cumulative play seconds and
session count, the open session's start timestamp (durable so a session
survives a plugin reload mid-game), the most recent session's duration, the
last-played timestamp, and a pending-session outbox (closed sessions awaiting
ingest into RomM's native ``/api/play-sessions``, keyed by start timestamp).
Individual completed sessions are not entities once ingested — only their start
(while open), their folded-in result, and the still-unsent outbox rows persist.
RomM's native play-session store is the shared additive record (ADR-0018); this
aggregate is the local durable + cumulative read model that reconciles with it.
The module also holds the pure kernels over play-session data: the two that gate
the outbox (``is_ingestable_session`` — what may enter it) and heal it
(``rejected_session_indices`` — which entries a whole-request 422 flagged), and the
two that read the server's session rows back for reconcile (``coerce_duration_ms``
and ``latest_end_time`` — the summed total and the newest end time the reconcile
verbs clamp against).
