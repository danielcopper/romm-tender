    This is the single multi-vs-single gate for the download path. It must
    mirror RomM's own download gate rather than RomM's ``has_multiple_files``
    flag, because the two are computed from different file counts:

    - RomM sets ``has_multiple_files = len(top_level_files) > 1`` — it counts
      only files at the ROM root.
    - RomM's download/content endpoint zips whenever ``len(rom.files) != 1`` —
      it counts *all* files, including ones in subfolders.

    A canonical Switch game is a folder with the base file at the root plus
    ``update/`` and ``dlc/`` in subfolders: exactly one top-level file, so
    ``has_multiple_files`` is ``False`` and ``has_nested_single_file`` is
