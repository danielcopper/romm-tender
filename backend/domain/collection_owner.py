"""Owner-scope classification for RomM collections.

The pure predicate behind the QAM "Mine / All" collection filter. RomM's
collection listings return the signed-in user's own collections plus every
other user's PUBLIC collection; "Mine" hides the foreign ones. This module owns
the single rule that decides whether a collection counts as the user's own —
used both to tag the frontend list (``is_own``) and to drop foreign units from
the sync work queue. No I/O, no state: identity and the collection's owner id
come in as arguments.

The scope value carried in settings is ``"own"``/``"all"``; only the QAM label
changed to "Mine"/"All" (#1539), so ``is_own`` and the ``collection_owner_scope``
value are unchanged.

Two invariants make the filter safe and non-breaking:

* **Virtual collections have no owner.** They are global/derived — RomM's
  ``VirtualCollection`` model carries no ``user_id`` column and returns them
  identically to every user — so they are always own and always survive a
  "Mine" filter.
* **Unknown identity degrades to "All".** When the plugin does not yet know its
  own user id (never fetched / offline), every collection is treated as own, so
  "Mine" filters nothing rather than filtering against the wrong identity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    collection_user_id:
        The collection's owner id (``user_id``) from the RomM listing dict, or
        ``None``/absent. Compared by value against *own_user_id*. Only standard
        and smart collections carry it; virtual collections never do.
    own_user_id:
        The signed-in user's own id (``settings["romm_user_id"]``), or ``None``
        when identity is not yet known.
    kind:
        ``"standard"``, ``"smart"`` or ``"virtual"``.

    Returns ``True`` (own) when the collection is a virtual collection (no
    owner), when our own identity is unknown (the non-breaking fallback), or
    when the collection's owner id equals ours. ``False`` (foreign) only when a
    standard/smart collection is owned by a different known id.
