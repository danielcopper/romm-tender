"""Deterministic sibling-group representative resolution + canonical naming (ADR-0021 §3).

A sibling group is one game with several released dumps (region / language /
revision variants). :func:`group_rows` is the partition of a **row list** — which
rows in it form a group, and the rule that a NULL key is a singleton. It is not
the only route to a group: a caller that wants one group by its key queries the
repository for it (``uow.roms.iter_by_group_key``) and guards the NULL case
itself, which several do. The rest answers two questions about a group, both a
pure, shuffle-stable compute over its fetched members:

* **Which version does the group bind to** — :func:`resolve_group_representative`.
  The resolution chain::

      installed sibling > existing binding > RomM default (is_main_sibling) >
      prerelease demotion > region priority > revision (newest) >
      alphabetical fs_name_no_ext > rom_id

  The first three are membership *filters*; the last four are the total order
  (a 1G1R-style ranking, matching igir / the No-Intro convention) applied to
  whatever survived the highest non-empty filter: a finished (retail) dump beats
  every prerelease across all regions, then region preference decides, then the
  newest revision within a region, then RomM's own alphabetical grouped-view
  fallback (so an ungroomed retail library with no region signal resolves
  identically to the RomM web UI), then rom_id.

* **What the group's Steam shortcut is named** — :func:`canonical_group_name`.
  The name follows the *pure* order above (prerelease > region > revision >
  alphabetical > rom_id) over ALL members, ignoring the installed/binding/default
  filters. This decides
  the mint-time shortcut name only; a shortcut's name is sticky forever after
  (ADR-0021 §2), so this is never re-applied to an already-bound group.

Region priority ranks a version by its best region against a build-time default
(:data:`DEFAULT_REGION_PRIORITY`), which the user may re-head with a single
``preferred_region`` choice. The preference enters as an explicit parameter —
reading it from settings is the service layer's job; this module stays pure,
stdlib only, with no I/O and no service/adapter imports.
