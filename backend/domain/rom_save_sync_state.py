"""RomSaveSyncState — per-ROM save-sync state for one tracked ROM.

The active slot and whether the user confirmed it, the emulator/system the ROM
runs under, the last core synced, our upload attribution, the merged slot
listing the UI reads, and the per-file sync baselines the newest-wins matrix
uses to detect drift. References its Rom by id (the registry key). The merge
logic that produces the slot listing lives in a service; this aggregate accepts
the result and guards the slot/file invariants. Tracks save *files* (SRAM) only
— the savestate twin, if ever built, is RomSavestateSyncState (see
docs/architecture/database-design.md, "Reserved naming").

Invariants enforced here:

1. A tracked file (an entry in ``files``) always carries a non-empty hash
   baseline. :meth:`adopt_baseline` is the strict entry point — it additionally
   requires a server save id; :meth:`update_baseline_hash` is the relaxed
   skip-adopt entry point that records only the hash when no server id is known.
2. A non-legacy active slot always has its key present in ``slots`` (the legacy
   ``None`` slot uses the ``""`` key).
3. ``own_upload_ids`` never grows by mutating ``None`` — :meth:`track_own_upload`
   starts a list when attribution was previously unknown.

``FileSyncState`` is the immutable per-file value object the aggregate builds
whole; it has no behaviour of its own.
