"""Sibling-group key derivation — connected components over RomM's sibling edges.

Two RomM ROMs are the same game (siblings) when they share **any one** non-null
external-metadata id over seven sources (IGDB, ScreenScraper, Moby, RA, Hasheous,
LaunchBox, TGDB), scoped per platform. The client mirrors that relation by
building connected components over each fetch's ``sibling_roms`` edges and keying
a whole component by its **canonical source** — the highest-priority source
(``_META_ID_SOURCES`` order) whose value the component agrees on. Uneven id
coverage (the norm for regional variants with different titles, matched unevenly
by scrapers) then still lands every version of one game in a single group, while
a genuine cross-game bridge (two distinct values at the canonical source, smuggled
in via a shared lower-priority id) refuses to merge and every member keeps its own
solo key. An unmatched ROM with no edges is a solo group, exactly as on the server.

:func:`compute_component_group_keys` is the component kernel used at sync time;
:func:`compute_sibling_group_key` is the per-ROM coalesce-first fallback (a lone
ROM, a bridged member, an un-edged incremental row) and the membership fallback in
:mod:`services.version_switch`. :func:`target_in_sibling_group` is the single
membership authority the version picker and the switch decide by. Pure compute, no
I/O, stdlib only (see the ADR superseding ADR-0021 §1).
