"""Cover-art filename logic for the Steam grid and the per-ROM cover cache.

Pure naming logic for the filename conventions ArtworkService reads and
writes: the per-ROM ``{rom_id}.png`` cache name (in the plugin-owned cover
cache, keyed by RomM ID so every version of a sibling group keeps its own
cover), the final ``{app_id}p.png`` name Steam reads as the active shortcut's
portrait cover, the ``.tmp`` sidecar every write lands in before its atomic
rename, the legacy per-ROM staging name that predates the cache, and the
inverse parse of a grid entry back into its appId (plus the shortcut-appId
range check) for the orphaned grid-image cleanup. Filesystem I/O lives in
adapters; this module is import- and state-free.
