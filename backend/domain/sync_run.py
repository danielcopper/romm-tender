"""SyncRun — one sync operation modelled as a single-shot state machine.

A run starts ``running`` and transitions exactly once into a terminal state
(``completed`` / ``cancelled`` / ``interrupted`` / ``paused`` / ``errored``); the
terminal transition is irreversible. ``cancelled`` records user intent;
``interrupted`` records an external death (the frontend stopped responding, or the
backend was restarted mid-run); ``paused`` records a deliberate session-budget
gate stop (the run halted itself at a chunk boundary because Steam's renderer is
near its heap budget) — the splits let the UI say "interrupted" or "paused"
instead of blaming a stop on the user's Cancel button. All three are resumable.
Replaces the scattered last-sync scalars (last_sync timestamp,
sync_stats, last_synced_platforms, last_synced_collections) with one record
that carries the plan, the outcome, and the timestamps of a sync. The id and
all timestamps are injected by the caller — domain owns no clock or id source.
