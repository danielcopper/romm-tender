"""Canonical server-origin derivation and comparison for server-identity binding.

A stored Client API Token is minted against one RomM server and must never be
replayed against another. The comparison key is the **full origin** — scheme,
host, and (non-default) port — so this module turns an arbitrary user-entered
URL into that canonical key and answers whether two URLs name the same server.
``https://h`` and ``http://h`` are deliberately distinct origins: a downgrade to
plaintext is a different (and hostile) destination, not the same one.

Anything that needs to decide "is this URL the same server as that one?" or
"is this a usable http(s) server URL?" belongs here. Stdlib-only (``urllib``);
no I/O, no network — purely lexical normalization.
