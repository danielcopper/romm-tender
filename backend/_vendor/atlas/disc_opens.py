"""The files a launched disc file opens — each emulator's own open, read step for step (issue #716).

ES-DE accepts a file by its extension alone, so a disc's ``.cue`` and its
``.bin`` tracks, and an ``.m3u`` listing several discs, all answer
``launchable``. What tells them apart is what the emulator does with each,
and that is what this module reads: the files the emulator opens through the
launched file, in the order it opens them, each either **named** by the text
of another file (a cue sheet's ``FILE``, a playlist's line) or **derived from a
name** (a ``.sbi`` beside the image, the ``<cue stem>.bin`` a cue's missing
first file is looked for as). Every lookup goes to the filesystem the emulator
opens it on, exactly as spelled — on Linux's own filesystems that is case
sensitive, as ``fopen`` is, and atlas asks the same filesystem.

Four readings are served. Every citation is at the build atlas pins for
that emulator elsewhere — DuckStation at RetroDECK/Duckstation@1f6de046b,
SwanStation at libretro/swanstation@4d309c0, Beetle PSX at
libretro/beetle-psx-libretro@d6383bf, Beetle Saturn at ccba526, Beetle PCE at
9a301c0, Beetle PC-FX at dd04cef, Flycast at flyinghead/flycast@1dac369 and
Genesis Plus GX at libretro/Genesis-Plus-GX@46a5521 — save Beetle PCE Fast,
which atlas pins nowhere else: its citations are at 7e9b257, pinned here
first. RetroArch's part, where a core's reading depends on it, is cited at
libretro/RetroArch@a79435a.

**DuckStation and SwanStation** share one open (``CDImage::Open``,
DuckStation ``src/util/cd_image.cpp:53-138``, SwanStation
``src/common/cd_image.cpp:18-72``): the suffix after the last ``.`` of the
whole path decides, ignoring case. A ``.cue`` is parsed whole first in the
grammar :mod:`atlas.psx_disc` ports (``cue_parser.cpp``, the same in both,
``BINARY`` the only ``FILE`` type it takes), including the order check of
``SetTrackLengths`` (DuckStation :442-470, SwanStation :435-463); then its
files are opened per track, track 1 upward until a number is missing, each
file once, beside the cue unless absolute (``cd_image_cue.cpp:83-128`` /
:69-118). A first file that will not open is looked for again as the cue's
own path with its extension replaced by ``bin`` (:105-116 / :91-102). A bare
``.bin``, ``.img`` or ``.iso`` is opened as itself; an ``.mds`` opens the
``.mdf`` of its own name (``cd_image_mds.cpp:90`` / :78) after reading its own
descriptor, which atlas does not read. Each of these then looks for the
``.sbi`` of its own name — DuckStation the ``.lsd`` too where that does not
load (``cd_subchannel_replacement.cpp:133-142``; SwanStation :91-94). An
``.m3u`` opens its first entry at launch and every other only when the
player switches to it (``cd_image_m3u.cpp:62-160`` / :49-144), so a nested
playlist contributes its first entry alone. Where the setting that loads
patches is on, a ``.ppf`` of the image's name is looked for: DuckStation for
every image it opens, the playlist itself included, where a patch it cannot
apply fails the open (``cd_image.cpp:120-135``, ``[CDROM] LoadImagePatches``
read once before the boot, ``system.cpp:1625``); SwanStation for the launched
path alone, falling back to the unpatched image (``system.cpp:566-588``,
the core option ``swanstation_CDROM_LoadImagePatches``).

**The mednafen cores** — Beetle PSX and its hardware build, Beetle Saturn,
Beetle PCE, PCE Fast and PC-FX — open a cue sheet in ``CDAccess_Image``,
which opens every ``FILE`` at its line, beside the cue unless absolute, and
reads the track type that follows (Beetle PSX ``CDAccess_Image.cpp:617-670``;
the four newer copies, e.g. Saturn :586-628): ``BINARY`` and the raw audio
types are taken as they are, the types handed to an audio reader are decided
by the file's bytes (the Ogg Vorbis reader alone, ``audioreader.cpp:167-170``;
``CDAFReader.cpp:45-52`` without ``HAVE_MPC``), and any other type, MP3 among
them, ends the open. After the sheet the ``.sbi`` of the cue's name is looked
for, its extension cased like the cue's (:899-921; Saturn :864-881). A
``.ccd`` opens the ``.img`` and ``.sub`` of its own name, cased the same way,
after its own sections (``CDAccess_CCD.cpp:79-288``). An ``.m3u`` is read by
``ReadM3U`` (:mod:`atlas.psx_region`), every disc it names opened at load.
Beetle PSX loads the ``.toc`` of the content's name in place of the content
where one is there (:func:`atlas.psx_region.beetle_toc`).

**Flycast** reads its own three formats (``retro_load_game``,
``libretro.cpp:2100-2307``). A ``.gdi`` (``gdi.cpp:6-116``) is a stream of
whitespace-separated fields: a track count, then per track its number, start,
control, sector size, a name quoted or one token, and an offset; a track's
file is opened only where its sector size is not 0, and a sheet of fewer than
three tracks fails after its files opened. A ``.cue`` (``cue.cpp:46-250``) is
read a line at a time: the ``FILE`` type is never checked, the track's file is
opened at its ``INDEX 01`` and the track mode checked after it, and a sheet
without a ``REM SESSION`` line needs three tracks. Either sheet's file is
joined onto its directory with a ``/`` whatever the name, an absolute one
too, and a sheet past 8192 bytes (``.gdi``) or 65535 (``.cue``) is refused by
its size. A parser that reads a variable it never set — a ``.gdi`` declaring
more tracks than it holds, a line that ends where a field is read — is
undefined from there; a quoted name no quote ends loops forever. An ``.m3u``
is taken as a playlist only where the file's name, cut to 127 bytes, ends in
``.m3u`` or ``.M3U`` (``libretro.cpp:2117``, :2159-2187); ``read_m3u``
(:3740-3792) skips a ``#`` in the first column, ends a line at its first
``\r`` or ``\n``, drops one leading and one trailing ``"``, and joins a
relative line onto the content's directory cut to 1023 bytes. Its first disc
is opened at launch through ``Emulator::loadGame`` (``emulator.cpp:547-621``),
which takes an arcade or executable name as no disc; every other one only on
a disc switch, through ``OpenDisc`` alone (``common.cpp:86-97``, :366-369).

**Genesis Plus GX** opens everything through ``cdd_load``
(``cdd.c:390-1304``). A path whose last three characters are ``cue`` or
``CUE`` is a cue sheet, read in 127-byte pieces: only spaces lead a line, a
``FILE`` name is written after the last separator of the path built before it
and cut where the whole reaches 255 bytes, a file that will not open ends the
parse, and a type other than ``BINARY`` or ``MOTOROLA`` is decided by the
file's bytes; a track ends at an ``INDEX 01`` line, 99 at most. The ``.sub``
it looks for is the last path built with its last four bytes replaced. Any
other file is a CD data track or a cartridge by its first bytes, and the
``.cue`` of its name is looked for either way (:586-660); where no track
mounts, ``load_rom`` loads the file it was handed as a cartridge
(``loadrom.c:579-597``), up to 10 MiB. Without that ``.cue``, a file a
cartridge load takes therefore launches whatever its bytes are; a disc
switch runs ``cdd_load`` alone (``libretro.c:2817``), so there a file that
mounts no track fails the switch. A first track with no ``FILE`` opened
for it crashes the core, which reads or seeks on a stream it never opened
(cdd.c:826-836, :949-951). An ``.m3u`` — by any case, since RetroArch hands
the extension over lowercased — names at most four discs
(``libretro.c:2762``, :3563-3633), each joined onto the content's directory
with a ``/``, a blank line too; the first is loaded at launch and the
others on a disc switch.

The cores part on what happens when the open fails, and that is what the
verdict follows (D4 and D5 of #716). Beetle PSX checks each ``FILE`` open
(``CDAccess_Image.cpp:642-643``) and the result of the sheet for a directly launched file
(``libretro.cpp:4172-4174``), so there it stops; a disc of a playlist is
loaded whether it opened or not (:4110-4123). The four newer cores never
fail a ``FileStream`` open (``FileStream.cpp``, e.g. Saturn :28-31) and discard what the
sheet's read returns (e.g. Saturn ``CDAccess_Image.cpp:911-916``), so they go
on without whatever is missing or refused. DuckStation and SwanStation stop
where the disc opened at launch fails, and only there. Beetle PCE and PCE
Fast set the result of a load only in their single-disc branch, so every
``.m3u`` fails after its discs were opened (PCE ``libretro.cpp:685-722``,
PCE Fast :1420-1458). Flycast stops where the disc it opens at launch fails,
and goes on where a disc switch fails. Genesis Plus GX stops where no track of
the disc loaded at launch mounts — its first file missing, a sheet with no
track, a file that is no cue sheet and no CD — since it then loads that file
as a cartridge instead, and where a sheet it parses at launch crashes it, the
``.cue`` of a cartridge's name included; a later track missing leaves the disc
mounted with the tracks before it, and a disc switch that fails leaves the
launch as it was.

What atlas does not read is stated rather than guessed: a file whose bytes
decide (an audio track a reader opens, an ``.mds`` or ``.ccd`` descriptor, a
patch DuckStation applies, an ``.sbi`` the newer cores check), a format this
cut does not follow (``.chd``, ``.pbp``, ``.ecm``, ``.toc``), a track's length
against its file's size, and a setting that could not be read. A path the
system cannot open at all — 4096 bytes or more, Linux's limit whatever the
filesystem — is what the emulator's open fails on: it is stated once as such,
cut to :data:`MAX_SHOWN` characters, and never looked up or listed. A long
name inside a shorter path goes to the real lookup, since how long a name may
be is each filesystem's own.

The walk is bounded, because the content is untrusted: :data:`MAX_LISTED`
distinct files, :data:`MAX_NESTING` playlists deep, :data:`MAX_TRACKS` tracks
in one sheet, :data:`MAX_STEPS` steps, :data:`MAX_READ_BYTES` bytes read and
:data:`MAX_OUTPUT` characters of answer. Every file opened or looked for is a
step, again on every visit, since the emulators open a playlist or a disc
named twice twice; so is every line of a playlist read and every line of a
cue sheet parsed or walked, and every 1023-byte piece DuckStation's ``fgets``
cuts a longer sheet line into, counted from above. A mednafen core's
playlists and sheets are read afresh on every visit, as the core reads them;
DuckStation and SwanStation read a nested playlist or a sheet once per
spelling of its path and reading, and keep only its first entry or its parsed
tracks. Every read is charged to the byte bound whatever it returned — the
text, or the file's size up to its bound and the byte past it — and the bound
is checked after each read, so a reading stops at most one read past it. A
cue sheet's bound is :data:`atlas.psx_disc.MAX_CUE_BYTES`, a playlist's
:data:`atlas.psx_region.PLAYLIST_LIMIT`. Every listed path and the file naming
it, every disc path a mednafen playlist names while its list is read, every
playlist entry, sheet track and refused sheet's file and type DuckStation and
SwanStation keep, and every caveat and source is charged to the output bound,
and a caveat is stated once per code, file and effect — remembered by its
path, or past :data:`MAX_SHOWN` characters by the shown form and a digest,
which is charged with it. So what one reading holds is bounded three ways:
the texts on its current path of reads, at most :data:`MAX_READ_BYTES` of
file bytes together (up to four times that in memory for text outside
Latin-1); its answer with everything it remembers to build it, at most
:data:`MAX_OUTPUT` characters; and one parse at a time of at most
:data:`MAX_STEPS` lines.

A NUL cannot reach a path: both emulators hand a name on as a C string, so a
playlist entry ends at its first NUL (:mod:`atlas.psx_region`) and a cue
sheet's line already does.
