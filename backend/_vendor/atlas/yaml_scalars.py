"""A deliberately small reader for the flat half of a YAML configuration.

Two of the standalone emulators RetroDECK ships keep the paths atlas answers
from in YAML — RPCS3's ``vfs.yml`` maps ``/dev_hdd0/`` to the directory its
save tree hangs off, Vita3K's ``config.yml`` carries ``pref-path`` — and atlas
ships zero runtime dependencies, so there is no YAML library to reach for.

This module reads the part of such a file that can be read *exactly*, in the
same spirit as the Cemu XML read and the melonDS legacy-INI scan: top-level
``key: value`` scalars, quoted or bare, with ``$(Name)`` substitution from
another key in the same file — which is how RPCS3 composes every device path
off ``$(EmulatorDir)``.

Everything else is refused rather than guessed, and the refusal is *named* so a
caller can tell "atlas did not read this" from "this is not set":

- a key whose value is a **nested block, a list or a multi-line scalar** is
  recorded in :attr:`YamlScalars.skipped` by name and not parsed. RPCS3's
  ``/dev_usb***/`` is one of those, and nothing atlas answers needs it, so the
  file still speaks while the reader stays honest about which key it passed
  over. Asking for a skipped key raises rather than answering a default.
- **anchors, aliases, tags and multiple documents** change meaning beyond the
  line they sit on — an alias can make a key elsewhere mean something this
  reader never saw — so they refuse the whole file, not one key.
- a **substitution cycle** refuses rather than looping.

What this is not: a YAML parser. It does not build a tree, it does not type
values (everything is the text as written), and it will refuse or skip a great
deal of legal YAML. That is the point — the alternative is a half-parser whose
mistakes look like answers.

Pure text in, value object out. No I/O — the machine seam supplies the text.
