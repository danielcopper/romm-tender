"""TypedDicts for RomM's 4.9 Device Sync (negotiate) wire protocol.

The dict shapes exchanged with ``POST /api/sync/negotiate`` and
``POST /api/sync/sessions/{id}/complete``: the client's per-save inventory
(``ClientSaveState``), the server's planned operations (``SyncOperation`` /
``SyncNegotiateResponse``), and the session-completion records. Mirrors the
shipped RomM 4.9.2 OpenAPI schema field-for-field — required keys are plain,
server-optional / nullable keys are ``NotRequired[... | None]``. Runtime dicts;
these describe the wire contract without changing their identity.

Note (ADR-0017): ``negotiate`` is kept only as a session **transport**. The
save-sync engine reads its response solely for ``session_id`` (the session
envelope) and intentionally ignores the planned ``operations`` — detection is the
local ``compute_sync_action`` matrix. ``SyncOperation`` / ``SyncNegotiateResponse``
remain the typed wire shape of the response, not a decision input.
