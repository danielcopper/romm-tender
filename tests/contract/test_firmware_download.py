"""Contract tests for the per-row BIOS download over the real nesting (#164).

``download_platform_firmware_file`` is the Library page's per-file Download
button. It addresses the file by NAME within the platform, so what this tier
pins is the scoping the name is resolved under — the same firmware-slug mapping
``download_all_firmware`` uses — plus the two answers a press can get that the
service tier states in isolation: a name the platform's listing does not hold,
and a file already sitting at its destination.

The bytes land through the real ``FirmwareFileAdapter`` under ``tmp_path``, and
the download record lands through the real Unit of Work, so a passing happy path
also proves the placement and the record the later Delete BIOS is authorized by.
