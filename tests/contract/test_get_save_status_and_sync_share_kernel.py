"""Contract test: ``get_save_status`` and ``sync_rom_saves`` share one kernel (ADR-0017).

Phase D collapsed the legacy/negotiate sync fork: every ROM now decides via the
local ``compute_sync_action`` matrix, the same kernel ``get_save_status`` reads.
Before the collapse, a confirmed non-legacy ROM's ``sync_rom_saves`` handed
detection to RomM's ``negotiate`` operation list while ``get_save_status`` used
the matrix — so the two could disagree.

This is the regression guard for the divergence the phase closes. It seeds the
branch-6d adopt case (``domain/sync_action._decide_when_no_entry``): a server save
whose ``content_hash`` is byte-identical to the local file, with NO
``device_syncs`` entry for this device. The matrix verdict is
``Skip(adopt_baseline=True)`` — nothing to transfer, no conflict, adopt the local
hash as the baseline. Under the old fork the ``FakeRommApi.negotiate`` empty plan
would have dispatched nothing (no baseline adopted), diverging from the status
view. Now both derive from the one kernel, so they agree: status reports
``synced`` / no conflict, sync transfers nothing / raises no conflict, and BOTH
adopt the baseline.
