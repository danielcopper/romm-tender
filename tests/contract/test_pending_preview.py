"""Contract tests for ``get_pending_preview`` — the preview a remounted panel asks for.

The QAM panel loses its preview card whenever the user navigates into a
submenu, while the backend goes on holding the staged snapshot for its full
TTL. This callable is how the panel gets the card back, so what it returns has
to be exactly the payload ``sync_preview`` answered with — including the
absolute ``expires_at`` deadline the card counts down against — and "nothing
pending" has to read as a normal answer rather than a failure.

Driven through the real callables over the real wired plugin.
