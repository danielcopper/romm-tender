"""Contract test for the #1298 sibling-supersede cleanup on download start.

Driven frontend-shaped: ``startDownload = callable<[number], ...>``. Starting a
download for a version whose sibling group already has ANOTHER version on disk
strips that install FIRST (files + ``rom_installs`` row; saves untouched, per
ADR-0007), then the download proceeds — the "at most one downloaded version per
group" rule. A grandfathered sibling (its own Steam shortcut) is never touched.

Drives the real ``DownloadService`` → ``RomRemovalService`` wiring (the real
``LateBinding`` that closes their construction cycle) over real SQLite + real
file stores under ``tmp_path``; only the RomM transport is the fake.
