"""Contract tests for ``reconcile_playtime`` — the flush → GET → max() path.

Driven frontend-shaped per ``frontend/src/api/backend.ts``:
``reconcile_playtime`` takes one positional ROM id and returns
``{total_seconds, session_count, server_query_failed}``.

The reconcile drains the local outbox into RomM's native ``/api/play-sessions``
ingest, then reads the ROM's cross-device session union back and folds its summed
duration into the local total via ``max()`` (playtime is monotonic — the pull
never regresses local play). These cases exercise that through the real harness:
the outbox is flushed, a foreign device's history is unioned in, and an
unreachable GET degrades to the local total.
