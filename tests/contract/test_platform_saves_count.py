"""Contract tests for ``count_platform_saves`` over the real nesting.

The read half of ``delete_platform_saves``, and the number the Library page's
Delete _N_ save files button offers. What this tier pins is that the two agree
over the real installed-ROM rows and the real saves tree: what the count reports
is what the delete removes, and counting removes nothing.

The button disables at zero rather than disappearing, so the answer for a
platform holding nothing has to be a real ``0`` — an absent or refused answer
would leave the button in whatever state the previous platform put it in.
