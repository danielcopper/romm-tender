"""Contract tests for the platform-toggle callables (#1007).

Drives the real ``Plugin`` over the real ``bootstrap`` to pin the
end-to-end behavior the data-loss fix restores: opening the Platforms page
(``get_platforms``) materializes the full per-platform enabled map into the
real ``settings.json``, and un-toggling exactly ONE platform
(``save_platform_sync``) leaves every other platform enabled — both on disk
and in the sync-time platform filter.

Each callable is driven exactly as the frontend declares it in
``src/api/backend.ts``: ``get_platforms()`` zero-arg, ``save_platform_sync``
with ``(platform_id: number, enabled: boolean)``.
