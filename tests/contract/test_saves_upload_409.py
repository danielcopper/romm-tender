"""Contract tests for the upload-time 409 backstop (ADR-0017, #1276).

Driven frontend-shaped through the real ``Endpoints`` / ``bootstrap`` harness.
The automatic save-sync dispatch always POSTs a new save with
``overwrite=false``; RomM answers a stale-current race with a 409 that the
matrix backstops by re-fetching the slot and re-deciding purely from hashes
(``resolve_upload_conflict``): a provably-unchanged local downloads the fresh
head, anything else surfaces a conflict. ``keep_local`` conflict resolution
instead POSTs with ``overwrite=true`` (the user's content wins outright).

These tests stay on the legacy ``compute_sync_action`` matrix path
(``active_slot`` set but ``slot_confirmed=False``) so the POST→409 backstop is
actually exercised — the negotiate transport returns an empty plan under the
``FakeRommApi`` and the engine fork is not collapsed until a later phase.
