"""Contract tests for the core-selection callables over the real nesting.

``CoreService.clear_game_core`` (Reset / Follow default) and
``set_system_core`` (per-platform core change fan-out) both re-bake a ROM's
Steam ``launch_options`` from its active core, resolved through the real
:class:`ActiveCoreResolver` — which opens its **own** Unit of Work.

The unit tests inject a ``FakeActiveCoreResolver`` (no real UoW), so they never
exercise the nesting. This tier drives the **real** callables over the
**real** file-based SQLite UoW the harness wires: every UoW opens with
``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` (the per-connection write lock), and the lock is not
re-entrant. Resolving the active core inside the still-open write UoW would
block the resolver's own UoW until ``busy_timeout`` then raise
``database is locked`` (#1047 / #1134) — which is why the write UoW is closed
before the resolve. ``clear_game_core`` additionally must resolve *after* the
pin-clear commits so the resolver reads the landed NULL and bakes the
POST-clear core, never the just-cleared pin (#1047).

The resolution reads the live ``es_systems.xml`` the harness seeds under
``tmp_path`` (#1210) — there is no ``core_defaults`` snapshot. The last block
pins the SHAPE of the three emulator-picker payloads — the game-detail
``get_platform_core_info``, the platform-keyed ``get_system_core_info`` the
Library page's Platforms detail asks, and the ``get_firmware_status`` overview —
with the emulator list present (happy) and absent (emulator data unavailable).
