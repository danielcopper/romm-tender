"""Contract tests for the ``evaluate_launch`` launch-gate callable.

Driven frontend-shaped per ``frontend/src/api/backend.ts``: ``evaluate_launch``
takes a single positional Steam app id and returns the ``LaunchVerdict`` dict
(``action`` / ``reason`` / ``toast_title`` / ``toast_body``).

The save-sync-disabled cases are the #1056 regression guard: with the feature
off, an installed ROM must launch (``action="allow"``) and the gate must not
perform a RomM ``list_saves`` round-trip — even when a server save exists that
would otherwise surface as a conflict. The enabled case is the control proving
the round-trip is a real, toggle-driven difference, not an unconditional skip.
