"""Contract tests for the server-hash baseline identity check (#1468).

Drives the real ``Endpoints`` over the real ``bootstrap`` to prove the two identity
routes at the wire:

- **Provenance** (primary): a file with sync history whose stored server hash
  (``last_sync_server_hash``) matches the server head's ``content_hash`` syncs
  cleanly even when the LOCALLY-recomputed parity hash no longer matches the
  server's — the scheme-drift robustness the issue is about. No parity
  agreement is consulted.
- **Parity** (fallback): a fresh-install / copied-SD-card file with NO sync
  history (no stored server hash) whose bytes are byte-identical to the server
  head is still adopted via the direct ``local_hash == content_hash`` check.
