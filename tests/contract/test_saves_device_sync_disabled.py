"""Contract test for RomM's per-device sync-disabled policy stop (#1489).

Driven frontend-shaped through the real ``Endpoints`` / ``bootstrap`` harness: when
RomM has save sync disabled for this device, the negotiate 400 surfaces as a
``device_sync_disabled`` policy stop carrying the canonical failure shape, and no
upload is attempted (the run aborts at the negotiate step, before the matrix).
