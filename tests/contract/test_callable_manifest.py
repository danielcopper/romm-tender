"""Frontend↔backend callable-manifest parity, surfaced inside the pytest run.

This pins the exact contract the CI gate (``scripts/check_callable_manifest.py``)
enforces: every ``callable<[Args], Return>("name")`` declared on the frontend
(``frontend/src/**/*.ts``) has a matching public ``async def name`` on the
``Plugin`` class in ``main.py``, in both directions, with matching arity. It is
the static-parity sibling of the rest of ``tests/contract/`` — those tests
*drive* the real callables frontend-shaped; this one asserts the two
*declarations* agree before any callable is driven, so a renamed/added/removed
callable or an arity drift breaks the pytest run, not just the standalone lint
gate.

The parser functions are imported from the gate script (loaded via ``importlib``
because ``scripts/`` is not on ``sys.path``), so the test and the CI gate share
one implementation — they can never disagree about what "matches" means.
