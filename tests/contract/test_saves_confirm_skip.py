"""Contract tests for the post-upload confirm-download skip (#1458) and the
dedup-to-non-head guard (#1482).

Driven frontend-shaped through the real ``Endpoints`` / ``bootstrap`` harness. A
normal automatic upload leaves this device ``is_current`` via ``add_save``'s own
DeviceSaveSync upsert, so the sync engine skips the redundant
``POST /saves/{id}/downloaded`` ack (#1458). When ``add_save``'s content-dedup
early-returns a matching save that is *not* the slot head (an older version while
a newer, different head still leads), the upload never became the head, so the
guard routes the response through the 409 backstop and surfaces a conflict rather
than a false ``synced`` (#1482) — no ack fires on that path. The #1458 ack itself
(fail-open on a not-provably-current dedup response) is exercised at the unit tier
(``TestConfirmUploadSyncDiscriminator``), where the guard is inert.

Both scenarios stay on the legacy ``compute_sync_action`` matrix path
(``active_slot`` set, ``slot_confirmed`` unset) so the POST is actually
dispatched, matching the ``test_saves_upload_409`` fixtures.
