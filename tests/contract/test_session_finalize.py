"""Contract tests for the ``finalize_game_session`` end-of-session callable.

Driven frontend-shaped per ``frontend/src/api/backend.ts``:
``finalize_game_session`` takes ONE positional arg — the RomM ROM id — and
returns the ``SessionFinalizeResult`` dict (``total_seconds`` / ``sync`` /
``migration``).

The suspend-exclusion cases (#1148) are the regression guard: the counted
``total_seconds`` is the AWAKE span derived from the monotonic clock — wall time
that elapsed while the device was suspended (the monotonic clock pauses) is not
counted. The zero-suspend case is the control proving the exclusion is a real,
monotonic-driven difference.

A session is opened via the real ``record_session_start`` callable (which stamps
both the wall and monotonic starts from the deterministic ``FakeClock``); the
clock is then advanced before finalize stamps the end — ``advance`` for awake
time (both clocks) and ``advance_wall`` for suspend (wall only, monotonic frozen).
