"""Contract test for the migration relaunch-items build over the real nesting.

``MigrationService._build_relaunch_items`` runs on a RetroDECK-home path
migration to re-bake every installed+bound ROM's Steam ``launch_options``
from the relocated path. It resolves each ROM's active core through the
real :class:`ActiveCoreResolver`, which opens its **own** Unit of Work.

The unit tests inject a ``FakeActiveCoreResolver`` (no real UoW), so they
never exercise that nesting. This tier drives the **real** service over the
**real** file-based SQLite UoW the harness wires: every UoW opens with
``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` (the per-connection write lock), and the lock is not
re-entrant. Resolving the core inside the install-iteration UoW would block
the resolver's own UoW until ``busy_timeout`` then raise
``database is locked`` (#1154) — which is why the build snapshots the rows
in one short read UoW and closes it before resolving.
