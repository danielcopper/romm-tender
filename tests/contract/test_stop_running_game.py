"""Contract test for the ``stop_running_game`` callable over the real ``Plugin``.

Driven frontend-shaped per ``frontend/src/api/backend.ts``:
``stopRunningGame = callable<[number], StopGameResult>`` — the rom id, passed
positionally.

Pins all three response shapes across the whole wire (real bootstrap → real
``wire_services`` → real ``GameProcessService`` → real
``RelaunchOptionsResolver`` over real SQLite), with only the process table
itself faked:

* nothing running → the canonical ``{success: False, reason: "not_running",
  message}`` failure, never the forbidden ``error`` / ``error_code`` keys;
* RetroDECK alive but running another game → ``game_not_running``, with nothing
  signalled;
* the instance running this ROM → ``{success: True, stopped, force_killed}``,
  and the app id the wiring asks about is RetroDECK's — proving ``bootstrap``
  threaded the single domain constant into the service rather than a second copy.

The launch path each instance is matched on comes from the real resolver over
real ``rom_installs`` rows, so this tier also pins that the read path and the
bake path agree: a seeded install's own file path is what identifies its
instance.
