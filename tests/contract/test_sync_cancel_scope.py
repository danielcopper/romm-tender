"""Contract tests for run-scoped ``cancel_sync`` (#1198).

A Cancel click meant for run A can land after run A finalized to IDLE and run
B started fresh. The argument-less cancel would flip run B to CANCELLING — a
sync the user never cancelled — so it would abort and report cancelled. The
run-scoped cancel ignores a stale run id; an unscoped (falsy) cancel still
cancels unconditionally.

Driven through the real ``cancel_sync`` callable over the real wired plugin,
asserting the response shape and the downstream effect on run B's terminal
``sync_complete`` event.
