"""Contract tests for cover-cache invalidation across sync runs (#1386).

Drives two real per-unit syncs over the real wired plugin: run one downloads a
new ROM's cover and records the ``cover_source`` fingerprint; the fake RomM then
changes the cover's ``?ts=`` cache-buster, and run two must re-download the
cache file and carry the ``{rom_id, app_id}`` refresh entry on the emitted
``sync_apply_unit`` payload — while the item itself stays delta-skipped (a
cover-only change never re-applies the shortcut). The NULL-adopt upgrade path
(a pre-#1386 row with an existing cache file) is exercised the same way and
must persist the fingerprint without any download.

The preview→apply flow gap is exercised through the callables the QAM actually
drives: ``sync_preview`` must count the cover-only work (``cover_refresh_count``)
without side effects, and the subsequent ``sync_apply_delta`` run must advance
the fingerprint and carry the refresh entry across the wire — while the pure
no-changes preview keeps its zero-everything shape.
