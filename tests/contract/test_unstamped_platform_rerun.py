"""Contract test for the unstamped-platform re-run (#1416).

After a heartbeat-timeout run's late ack recovers a chunk (#1367 / #1409), the
platform is complete but carries no ``PlatformSyncState`` stamp — the late-ack
path never stamps (ADR-0023). The next preview finds a zero shortcut delta, so
without a re-run signal the frontend short-circuits: the platform never
re-stamps (every future sync full-fetches it) and "Last sync: interrupted"
lingers indefinitely.

This drives the real Plugin through the real bootstrap: it builds that
complete-but-unstamped residue with real verbs (the repository stamp delete a
timeout leaves un-rewritten, plus a ``SyncRun.mark_interrupted`` newest attempt),
asserts the preview surfaces ``restamp_platform_count``, then asserts the gated
apply re-stamps the platform and records a fresh completed ``SyncRun`` that heals
the run status.
