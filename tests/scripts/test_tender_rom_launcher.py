"""Tests for ``bin/tender-rom-launcher`` — the Steam shortcut exec wrapper.

The launcher is a pure exec wrapper: Steam hands it the full launch command
(emulator invocation + ROM path) as argv, and it execs exactly that. It owns no
state, no path resolution, and no emulator knowledge. These tests run the real
bash script via ``subprocess`` and assert the exec-wrapper contract: argv is
passed through verbatim (spaces preserved), missing argv is rejected, and the
exec'd command's exit code propagates.
