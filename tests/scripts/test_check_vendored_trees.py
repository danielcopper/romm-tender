"""Tests for ``scripts/check_vendored_trees.py``.

The check is loaded via ``importlib`` because ``scripts/`` is not on
``sys.path`` (and is excluded from ruff/basedpyright). ``collect_discrepancies``
takes the vendor directory explicitly, so most cases lay out a small synthetic
``_vendor/`` under ``tmp_path`` and the real comparison logic runs against it.
The synthetic directory holds BOTH shapes the gate has to serve — a wheel copy
whose licence sits beside the tree and whose manifest is upstream's own, and a
patched copy whose licence sits inside the tree and whose manifest we generated
— because the gate discovers packages rather than being told about them, and a
one-package fixture cannot show that one tree's drift is reported against that
tree alone. The parser cases need no tree at all, and two cases deliberately use
the real one.

Coverage centres on the four ways a vendored copy stops being what its manifest
pins — a file tampered with, one deleted, one added, and a licence that no
longer matches — because a checksum gate that misses any of them is decorative.
The deleted and added cases are the reason this gate exists at all: ``sha256sum
-c --ignore-missing`` exits 0 on both. A fifth way is a copy that pins nothing:
a package directory with no manifest is a failure, since otherwise vendoring a
package and forgetting its manifest leaves an unguarded tree beside a guarded
one and everything stays green. A sixth is a licence the manifest cannot pin at
all, which is what regenerating a wheel's manifest from its own tree produces.
The manifest's own refusals are pinned too, since each would otherwise drop a
check silently: the three the parser makes (unparseable line, duplicate entry,
an ambiguous licence entry) and the two that happen before it ever runs (bytes
that do not decode, a file that cannot be opened). What the sweep does with
one is pinned at the clause that catches it: the refusal comes back as one
package's finding rather than ending the run, since a raise out of the loop
would take every other tree's drift with it. Two tests run against the REAL
vendored directory — one over ``collect_discrepancies`` and one over ``main``
— so the copies in this repository are verified by ``mise run test`` and not
only by ``mise run lint``.
