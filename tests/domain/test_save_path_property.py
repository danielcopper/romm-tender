"""Property-based tests for the canonical-target grouping key (#1028).

Invariant 1 (#1006 — cross-extension save corruption): a local file's sync
action must only ever be computed against server saves in its *own* canonical
target group. The grouping key is the pure
``compute_local_save_target(server_save, rom_name).filename`` — the same key
``services.saves._helpers.local_save_target`` wraps and the matrix groups by.

This property pins the *key*: grouping a generated server-save list by that
key never mixes two distinct canonical targets, and saves that differ only in
``file_extension`` for the same ``rom_name`` land in distinct groups. The
#1006 fix makes the matrix's local-file loop filter to this same group; the
key itself is already correct, so this is a live regression guard.

See ``tests.adapters.test_gavel_native_property`` for the convention note on the
``xfail(strict=True)`` pinning of properties that encode an open bug.
