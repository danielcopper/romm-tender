"""Construction helpers shared across the suite.

These live outside ``conftest.py`` on purpose. A conftest is imported by
pytest under its own module name; importing it a second time by plain name
(`from conftest import ...`) creates a *separate* module object that re-runs
the module body: a second suite home with ``HOME`` moved to it, ``backend/``
and ``tests/`` inserted into ``sys.path`` again, and the hypothesis profile
registered and loaded again. Anything a test module needs to import belongs
here instead.

Import as ``from _factories import _make_retry`` — ``tests/`` is on the path
via the root conftest, the same way ``fakes/`` is reached.
