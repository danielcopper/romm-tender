"""Records whether a Unit of Work was open when a seam ran.

GLOSSARY.md's Unit of Work entry keeps a transaction to database reads and
writes: the real ``SqliteUnitOfWork`` opens with ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``, SQLite's
global write lock, so a seam doing file or server I/O inside one blocks every
other connection in the backend until ``busy_timeout`` gives up. A test driving
:class:`FakeUnitOfWork` shares no connection and can never see that lock — the
observable is the ORDER, so this wraps one seam method and records, per call,
whether a unit was open at the moment it ran.

An assertion on the recorded list is non-vacuous both ways: ``[False]`` says the
seam ran once and ran outside, and an empty list — the seam never reached —
fails the same assertion rather than passing it.
