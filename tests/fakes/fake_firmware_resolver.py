    """The machine's firmware demand, stated by the test instead of read off disk.

    Seed it with :meth:`declare` — one call per file, naming the cores that
    require it and the cores that merely accept it. ``unread_cores`` names the
    emulators whose declaration could not be read, which is what decides whether
    a file the catalogue does not hold reads ``not_needed`` or ``unknown`` for a
    given platform; ``resolved=False`` stands for a reading that never happened
    at all.

    ``bios_root`` and ``present_probe`` are what make the fake a stand-in for a
    resolver that reads a disk: given them, each placement's ``present`` is
    looked up under the root at call time, so a test that puts a file in its
    BIOS directory gets the same answer the real resolver would give for it.
    ``_make_firmware_service`` wires both to the service's own BIOS root and
    file store, because that is the production relationship — one directory,
    two readers. Without a root there is nowhere to take a reading, so a
    placement's ``present`` stays ``None`` — withheld, not absent, which is the
    distinction the consumers are built around — unless :meth:`declare` said
    otherwise, and a test pins a reading the files would not give by passing
    ``present`` there.

    :meth:`record_system` states the second axis — what the packaged table says
    about the console one core declares for. It is per core rather than per file
    because the same images read differently under two cores of one system.

    ``calls`` counts invocations so a test can pin that a whole-machine question
    costing hundreds of milliseconds on a real device is asked once per query
    rather than once per platform.
