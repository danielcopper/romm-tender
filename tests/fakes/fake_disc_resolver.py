"""In-memory ``DiscResolver`` implementation for service tests.

Lets the launch-bake consumers (library sync, download-complete, RetroDECK-home
migration) and the disc-picker endpoints inject the disc-resolution seam without
standing up a real ``DiscLaunchResolver`` (directory scan + es_systems read +
``domain.disc_selection``). Configure per-``rom_dir`` disc lists; the default
(no discs seeded for a directory) reproduces a single-disc ROM, which resolves to
its own ``file_path`` unchanged — matching the real resolver's zero-behavior-
change contract for non-multi-disc ROMs. Each resolve call is recorded so a
consumer test can assert the seam was reached with the right pin.

    Seed a directory's discs via ``set_discs(rom_dir, discs)``; a directory with

    ``resolve_for_install`` mirror the real resolver's
    :func:`domain.disc_selection.resolve_launch_path` decision over the seeded
    discs, so a non-multi-disc ROM resolves to ``install.file_path`` unchanged and
    a pin resolves to the matching disc's path. An install the system cannot
    launch (``launchable is False``) resolves to ``""`` before any disc work, as
    the real resolver does. ``calls`` records each ``(rom_dir, selected_disc)``
    resolve so consumer tests can assert the seam was queried with the right pin.
