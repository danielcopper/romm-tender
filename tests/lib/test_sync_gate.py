"""Direct unit tests for the @sync_active_blocked decorator.

The decorator wraps callables on Plugin so they short-circuit with the
canonical failure shape whenever ``self._sync_service.is_sync_in_flight()``
is True. ``_sync_service`` is a hard requirement: a missing/None service is
a wiring regression and the wrapper raises ``RuntimeError`` rather than
silently skipping the safety gate. Tests use a minimal fake class with a
``_sync_service`` attribute to keep them independent from the full Plugin.
