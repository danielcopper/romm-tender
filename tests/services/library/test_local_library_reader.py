"""Tests for LocalLibraryReader — this device's own record of the library, read back out.

Driven through the shared ``plugin`` fixture so every read runs against the same
``FakeUnitOfWork`` the rest of the library suite seeds, rather than a mock of the
factory: what these methods return is only interesting relative to rows someone
actually persisted.

The projections are also exercised end-to-end where their consumers live — the
preview's cover-refresh and restamp counts in
``tests/services/library/test_sync_orchestrator.py``, the stale scan's
collision exclusion in the same file's late-ack reconciliation — so the tests
here pin the projection shapes those flows read through.
