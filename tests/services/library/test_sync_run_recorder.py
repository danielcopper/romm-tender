"""Tests for SyncRunRecorder — the ``SyncRun`` row one library-sync run leaves behind.

Driven through the shared ``library`` fixture so every write lands in the same
``FakeUnitOfWork`` the rest of the library suite seeds against: what a transition
did is only observable as the row it left, and the row is what the next preview's
baseline and the QAM's "Last sync" line read.

**Which** terminal a stopped run earns is the orchestrator's branch, not this
module's — a session-budget pause over a heartbeat timeout over the user's own
Cancel — and it is covered where that branch lives, which is two places in
``tests/services/library/test_sync_orchestrator.py``: ``TestSyncRunLifecycle``
for the cancel, the timeout and the error, and ``TestSessionBudgetGate`` for the
pause, next to the gate that triggers it. What is pinned here is that each
transition writes the status, reason and timestamp it names, and that the three
ways a write must decline to happen all decline silently.
