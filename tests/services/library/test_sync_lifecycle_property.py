"""Property test for the ``LibrarySyncStateBox`` run-lifecycle state machine.

Hypothesis drives random interleavings of the three lifecycle verbs
(``try_begin_run`` / ``request_cancel`` / ``finish_run``) against a reference
model and asserts the safety invariants directly: only one run is ever in
flight, a non-owner ``finish_run`` never disturbs the active run, and both
``current_sync_id`` and ``run_kind`` are ``None`` iff the box is IDLE. A
counterexample here is exactly the #1202 class of bug — a stale terminal
nulling a fresh run.
