"""Every emitted ``sync_progress`` frame that stops a run names a terminal stage.

The QAM panel derives "a sync run is in flight" from the emitted frame's
``running`` flag, and keys the run's end — the status line the run gets, the
live-ETA teardown, the stats and session-budget re-reads — on the frame's
*stage* (``frontend/src/bigpicture/MainPage.tsx``). A frame emitted with
``running`` false and a non-terminal stage would therefore collapse the
in-progress rows while ending nothing: no completion line, no re-read, and a
coarse bar frozen where it stood. Neither side's call site shows the coupling,
and the frontend cannot defend against it — a bare ``running: false`` is
indistinguishable from the panel's own retraction of an optimistic start.

The scan is structural rather than behavioural because the rule is about every
path that *can* emit, error paths included, not the ones a fixture happens to
provoke. It reaches three producer shapes across ``py_modules/services``, all
three of which exist today:

* a call to the orchestrator's ``emit_progress``, which the reporter reaches
  through its injected ``_emit_progress`` and ``services/artwork.py`` through an
  ``emit_progress`` callable passed in per operation;
* a direct write of the frame to ``sync_progress``, which the cancelled finalize
  and the error path use because they build the snapshot themselves;
* a frame handed straight to the emit primitive as ``_emit("sync_progress", {…})``.

Where the enforcement ends, stated plainly because the invariant register cites
this file: the scan reads call sites and dict literals, so a frame assembled by
a helper it cannot follow, or emitted through an aliased callable, is outside it.
Three such indirections exist today and all are inert rather than holes:

* the parameterized snapshot inside ``emit_progress`` itself (its ``running``
  and ``stage`` are its parameters, and every caller of it IS scanned);
* the fetcher's late-bound proxy in ``services/library/service.py``, which
  forwards whatever its own — scanned — callers passed it;
* ``finish_run``'s ``self.sync_progress = _default_progress()`` in
  ``services/library/_state.py``. This one is a write to the very attribute
  ``_snapshot_write_sites`` watches, and it is invisible only because the value
  is a call rather than a dict literal. **Leave it that way.** It is not a frame:
  nothing emits it, so nothing reaches the panel from it — it returns the
  snapshot ``get_sync_status`` answers with to the idle default once a run is
  over. Spelled as a literal it would read ``running: False`` with a non-terminal
  stage and this scan would flag it, which would be a false positive: the rule is
  about frames the panel is SENT, and no reader ever sees this one as an event.

:class:`TestScanScope` pins the rest of the scope so it cannot shrink unnoticed:
that the scan still reaches every module producing frames today, that no producer
lives outside its root, and that ``services/prune``'s unrelated method of the same
name lands inert rather than as a false offender in a foreign API.
