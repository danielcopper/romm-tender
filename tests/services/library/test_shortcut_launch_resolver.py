"""Tests for ShortcutLaunchResolver — it resolves each ROM's launch facts.

Driven through the shared ``plugin`` fixture so the emulator resolution runs
against the real :class:`ActiveCoreResolver` over the shared fake UoW — the same
seam the sync's bake sites draw from — rather than a mock of it.

The disc-resolved install paths (``do_scan_installed_paths`` /
``do_read_installed_paths``) are pinned in ``tests/services/test_disc_bake_sites.py``
alongside the other launch-bake sites, so a change to the disc pin's handling
fails every site at once. What is pinned HERE about those two is the boundary
that belongs to this module rather than to the disc pin: neither of them may
hold a Unit of Work open across the resolver's directory listing.
