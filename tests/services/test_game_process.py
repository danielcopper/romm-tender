"""Unit tests for ``GameProcessService`` — the stop-game escalation ladder.

Two safety rules are guarded here and neither may be weakened.

A still-alive process is NEVER asked to stop a second time (emulators skip their
save flush on the repeat and destroy the save file); the only escalation is the
force kill after the grace window. That rule has two halves — no retry inside
one call, and no second concurrent call — and
:class:`TestNeverRepeatsTheStopRequest` guards both.

And only the instance running the ROM the stop was pressed for is ever
signalled: RetroDECK can have several live at once, so signalling an unmatched
one ends another game mid-save. :class:`TestTargetsOnlyTheMatchedInstance`
guards that, asserting the OTHER instance's pids reached neither signal.
