"""Self-conformance of the plugin's save-path kernel against emu-atlas machine vectors.

emu-atlas (https://github.com/danielcopper/emu-atlas) is the config-aware emulator-knowledge
library extracted from this plugin; its ``machines`` vector family is the normative contract for
where a RetroArch / RetroDECK install keeps its saves, and its save-placement expectations were
oracle-derived from this repo's ``domain/save_path.resolve_save_dir`` /
``compute_local_save_target``. This tier drives the plugin's OWN kernel over the same fixture
machines and asserts it still agrees with the published contract where the two overlap.

The overlap is partial by design, so every one of the 16 vectors carries an explicit
``_CHECK_LEVELS`` entry:

- ``full`` — end-to-end placement. The plugin derives the saves root the same way atlas does (from
  ``retrodeck.json``, or the ``~/retrodeck`` fallback), so the final directory + filename strings
  are compared. RetroDECK-flavor ``InSaveDir`` vectors, plus the RetroDECK-first coexistence case.
- ``layout-only`` — only the ``retroarch.cfg`` interpretation overlaps. The plugin has no
  standalone-RetroArch saves-root concept (its saves base always comes from RetroDECK paths), so a
  vector whose placement hangs off a standalone ``savefile_directory`` cannot be checked
  end-to-end; what DOES overlap is the ``SaveLayout`` the plugin derives from the same cfg text —
  the sort flags for an ``InSaveDir`` placement, or the ``ContentDir`` (next-to-ROM) classification.
- ``n/a`` — no overlap. The plugin has no installation-enumeration surface, so atlas's
  "nothing detected" outcome has no plugin equivalent.

The vendored JSON under ``atlas_vectors/machines/`` is the contract's normative artifact and changes
only by a deliberate re-copy from upstream (see ``atlas_vectors/README.md``) — never by editing a
vector to match the kernel. A new upstream vector without a ``_CHECK_LEVELS`` entry fails at
collection rather than silently passing.
