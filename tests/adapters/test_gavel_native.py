"""Tests for the GavelNativeAdapter — the compiled save-sync decision core.

Two of the tiers guarding the shipped shared object live here, for both of the
decisions it owns (the upload-409 ladder and the full per-file sync action):

* **Unit** — the real vendored ``.so`` loads, decides the canonical cases
  (including the ``None`` vs ``""`` distinction and the marshalling boundaries
  where an "unknown" must stay a flag rather than become a value), and a bad
  path raises the distinct :class:`GavelNativeLoadError` naming the path.
* **Vendored-vector conformance** — every ``ladder`` gavel vector is replayed
  against the adapter, so the shipped binary must satisfy the normative contract
  the decision is held to. The decision-table family runs in
  ``tests/adapters/test_gavel_native_table_vectors.py``.
