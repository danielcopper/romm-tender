/**
 * Shared paced iteration for bulk Steam-shortcut operations.
 *
 * Steam mutates its in-memory shortcut store on every add/remove; driving those
 * mutations in a tight synchronous loop blocks the CEF renderer and can corrupt
 * that store (the documented removal-churn hazard, #977). Every bulk shortcut
 * loop — the sync add path and the DangerZone removal paths — runs through
 * {@link pacedForEach} so the pacing is defined in exactly one place and add and
 * remove can never diverge again. The add path paces one item at a time (the
 * CEF-safe 50ms cadence); bulk removals pace in larger chunks (a removal is a
 * single cheap call, so 25 back-to-back then one breather keeps the renderer
 * responsive at seconds of overhead instead of minutes).
