/**
 * Per-appId game-detail store — the shared state of one Steam game page.
 *
 * A game page mounts several RomM surfaces at once (the play section today, the
 * play button and the info panel next). Each used to fetch the cached detail,
 * keep its own `romId` / install / save-sync / BIOS / core copies, and run its
 * own near-duplicate `romm_data_changed` handlers, so the copies could disagree
 * (#993). Here there is one entry per appId: the first subscriber opens it,
 * loads the detail, and attaches the entry's event listeners; the last
 * unsubscribe tears the whole entry down.
 *
 * The DOM bus is unchanged — it still carries the notifications. What moved is
 * the state: one handler per appId folds an event into the entry, and every
 * subscriber re-renders from the same fold.
 *
 * Overlapping reads for one appId share a single request ({@link
 * refreshSaveStatus}), so a payload-less `save_sync` notification costs one
 * `get_save_status` round-trip however many surfaces are mounted.
 *
 * Follows the module-scope store shape of utils/connectionState.ts — state in
 * the module, a getter, a subscribe that hands back its own unsubscribe, and a
 * `use…()` hook over the same state — keyed by appId, and with the subscription
 * owning the entry's lifetime rather than only carrying a callback.

 * the failure: the bridge rejects the read — plugin_loader restarting under the
 * page, a closed WebSocket — while a user looking at a game page and doing
 * nothing else produces no download, no uninstall and no adoption for the entry
 * to take its cue from.
 *
 * One TIMER, for the entry's whole lifetime — {@link Entry.timedRetryUsed} is
 * spent where it is scheduled, so a retry that throws too schedules nothing
 * further, and a timer already pending when the event lane re-derives is not
 * withdrawn (that entry can see both). One rather than a ladder because the
 * plugin runs a readiness ladder at init already; a per-page lane that grew one
 * of its own would be racing it, page by page.
 *
 * Inert unless the entry is still the one this was scheduled for and is still
 * failed. The flag is cleared where a load is ISSUED, so an entry the event lane
 * has already recovered — or is mid-recovery on — reads nothing here; and the
 * generation covers the page closed in the meantime, so a retry falling due
 * after `closeEntry` finds a generation the entry has moved past.

/**
 * Whether an install-state event about `eventRomId` re-derives this entry.
 *
 * Normally that is the entry's own ROM and nothing else. The second arm is for
 * the entry that has no identity to match against because its load threw: the
 * first load installs the identity all three triggers are gated on, so without
 * this arm a first load that failed would leave them nothing to match (#1676).
 *
 * With no identity the entry cannot tell whether the event is about its game, so
 * it re-reads on any of them. The cost is bounded by what a user can do: one
 * network-free `get_cached_game_detail` per install-state event, and none at all
 * while a load is in flight or once one has answered.
 *
 * This lane is unbounded in time and bounded per event; {@link
 * scheduleFailedLoadRetry} is the other way round, and covers the page where the
 * user does nothing at all. Two things neither covers. A failure that outlives
 * the one timed retry on a page nothing then happens on: the timed lane is spent
 * and no event arrives, so the entry stays on the neutral default until a
 * version switch or the next page visit. And a read that HANGS rather than
 * rejects: `callable()` carries no timeout of its own — which is why index.tsx
 * and utils/connectionProbe.ts race every attempt against `CALLABLE_TIMEOUT` —
 * and this load awaits it bare, so the catch never runs, the flag both lanes
 * read is never set, and neither fires.
