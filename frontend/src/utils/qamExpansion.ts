/**
 * The two levers that widen the plugin's Quick Access Menu panel from 348 px to
 * 854 px, and the paths that clear them again.
 *
 * Steam ships no API for either. Both are internals with no compatibility
 * promise, measured on the device rather than read from documentation; the
 * decision to use them, and what it rests on, is
 * `docs/adr/0029-wide-qam-pages-drive-steams-friends-expansion.md`.
 *
 * The flag the first lever sets is Steam's own and global, so whoever sets it
 * clears it: a wide page that leaks it leaves Steam's QAM expanded until the
 * Friends tab toggles it back. `useWideQamPanel` covers the three paths a
 * mounted page can observe; `collapseQamOnDismount` is the fourth.
 *
 * The injected sheet carries two rules that are not about width: a focus
 * outline for a DISABLED button, which Steam's own stylesheet omits, and a
 * deliberate override of Steam's bottom padding on a tabbed page's content
 * scroller. Both ride here because the sheet is already scoped to the wide root
 * and a second injector would be a second thing to clear; both are stated in
 * full at `WIDE_PANEL_CSS`.

// Steam caps every tab's content panel at 300 px and lifts it only for its own
// Friends panel (ADR-0029). The cap is on the panel element itself: with these
// rules up, the device measured `#quickaccess_content_999` at 806 px. The `> *`
// line covers a child carrying a cap of its own, which was never separately
// measured and costs one selector to keep. `:has()` scopes the lift to a panel
// holding a wide page of ours.
//
// The second rule is about focus rather than width, and rides along because it
// needs the same sheet in the same document. A DISABLED button is still a focus
// stop — the device pass walked one with the stick — but Steam's own disabled
// treatment (`opacity: .4` over `rgba(61,67,77,.35)`, `library.css`) leaves
// almost nothing for a focus fill to change, so the reader loses their place on
// a row of buttons where one is disabled. Steam answers this for its own
// variants with `background: #000` on `.DialogButton[disabled].gpfocus`, but
// those rules are scoped to hashed class names ours does not carry. The outline
// is Steam's other focus form, taken verbatim from the one it uses where a fill
// will not read (`outline: outset #fff 2px`, `chunk~2dcc5aaf7.css`), and it is
// scoped to a wide page of ours.
//
// **The third rule overrides Steam's own styling, deliberately. It is not a
// defect fix, and Steam's rule is not wrong** — it is simply applied to a box
// that is ours. Steam's tabbed page gives its content scroller a
// `padding-bottom: 40px` (rule `._1X4dtbZ_AMX_DXT-SGiK01`, read off the live
// stylesheet in the QAM). That scroller sits INSIDE the body `WidePage` measured
// and handed the tab as its height, so on a tabbed page 40 px of a height the
// frame sized to the panel go to a reserve nothing of ours asked for — and the
// reader meets a band under Library that Settings and Sync do not have, those
// being untabbed and rendering no such scroller at all. Measured at the dev
// window's metrics: our body ran to y=752 inside a panel box ending at 764.3
// while the tab's content stopped at 712, and the tab's own scrolling region
// went from a `clientHeight` of 550 to 590 with this rule alone. What overriding
// it is worth is that difference: 40 px of content back on every tabbed wide
// page. The 602 the page reaches today is this rule and the frame's own gap
// going together — two changes, and only one of them is this one.
//
// It is ours to override because the box is ours: the scroller is rendered
// inside a page of ours at a height of our own measuring, and that measurement
// already stops the page at the panel's edge. Nothing outside a wide page is
// touched — the selector is scoped to our root, which is also what wins it: two
// classes against Steam's one, in a sheet appended after Steam's.
//
// **Written against the readable class, not the hashed one.** Steam ships both
// on that element (`_TabContentsScroll` beside `_1X4dtbZ_AMX_DXT-SGiK01`), and
// the hashed name is a build artefact that changes with Steam's bundle. Either
// could go, and the degradation is what makes reaching for someone else's class
// safe here: a selector that stops matching leaves Steam's padding standing,
// which is today's behaviour — the band comes back on tabbed pages and nothing
// else changes. Taking a padding away can only give room back, so there is no
// reading of a missed match that clips or overlaps content.
