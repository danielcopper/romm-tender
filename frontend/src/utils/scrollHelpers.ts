 * How far `el` sits below the start of `scroller`'s content, in layout terms.
 *
 * The two rects are viewport-relative and the scroller's own `scrollTop` moves
 * only one of them: scrolling it slides `el` up by exactly that much and leaves
 * the scroller's own box where it is, so adding `scrollTop` back cancels it
 * exactly. Scrolling anything ABOVE the scroller moves both boxes together and
 * cancels in the subtraction. `clientTop` is the scroller's top border, which
 * its rect includes and `clientHeight` does not.
 *
 * `el.offsetTop` would be shorter and is not taken: `offsetTop` is measured
 * against `offsetParent`, which is the scroller only while the scroller stays
 * positioned — Steam's QAM panel computes `position: relative` today, and that
 * is Steam's CSS to change, not ours. Nothing above reads any element's
