/**
 * Custom Play button that replaces the native Steam Play button on RomM game
 * detail pages. Primary states (the full set is `PlayButtonState`):
 * - Download: ROM not installed, click to download. The same state, while
 *   the recorded file of an installed ROM is gone, is a split button the size
 *   of Play — Download again, and an arrow whose "File missing" menu names the
 *   path and offers Download again and Forget this download — over a one-line
 *   "File missing" note, and no Play
 * - Play: ROM installed, launches the game (with pre-launch save sync)
 * - Checking: the launch check is running, before any sync
 * - Syncing: Save sync in progress before launch
 *
 * Includes a dropdown menu button (arrow) to the right of the Play button
 * with action: Uninstall.
