/**
 * The list-and-detail layout of a wide QAM page: the list on the left, the
 * focused entry's detail on the right, each scrolling on its own inside the
 * frame's measured height. It is `Columns` with those two columns.
 *
 * A region scrolls by moving focus, so what a reader must be able to reach in
 * either pane — a detail's table rows included — has to be focusable; plain
 * text scrolls along with the row it accompanies but cannot be scrolled to.
 *
 * Focus selects — moving through the list changes the detail at once, as Steam's
 * own settings do. The row's own control keeps A, so this component intercepts
 * it only where a page asks for `selectOnActivate`, for rows that carry no
 * control; a row that carries a toggle still toggles on press. A control that
 * acts on the whole list goes in `listHeader` rather than in a row, so reaching
 * it reports no selection.
 *
 * Selection is controlled: the page owns `selectedId` and decides what a change
 * means for the rest of it.
 *
 * Because focus selects, where the page OPENS decides what it opens on: entry
 * focus landing on the first row selects that row and overwrites the selection
 * the page was opened with. So the selected row declares itself the area entry
 * focus belongs in ({@link ENTRY_STOP_ATTR}) and the frame places focus there.
