/**
 * One scrolling region of a wide page, bounded by the height its parent gives it.
 *
 * The region is Steam's plain `ScrollPanel`, the container the QAM's own tab
 * panel is built from. It is not a focus stop of its own: the rows inside take
 * focus directly and Steam scrolls the focused row into view, which is how the
 * rest of the QAM scrolls. Reaching content is therefore the caller's side of
 * the bargain — every row a reader must reach is a focusable row, and text that
 * only accompanies one scrolls along with it.
 *
 * The one thing the caller cannot buy that way is the content OUTSIDE its
 * focusable rows: Steam scrolls a region only far enough to show the focused
 * element, so a heading or a column header over the topmost row stays off the
 * top, and a legend or a total under the last row stays off the bottom. That is
 * this component's own job, and it is here rather than on a page so that every
 * region built with `ScrollRegion` inherits it — see `revealEdge`. That is not
 * every region on every wide page: a TABBED page's content sits in Steam's own
 * `ScrollingTab`, which the frame does not wrap, so a tab that does not build
 * its own regions does not get this.
 *
 * The panel comes from a webpack probe that can miss, and a page whose regions
 * silently vanish would be worse than one that scrolls without what the panel
 * adds on top — so the fallback keeps the region, its bounds and its place in
 * the focus tree, and gives up Steam's scroll padding, its own focus-ring root
 * and the ref that scrolls the focused element back into view after a resize.
 *
 * Structure and vocabulary: `docs/architecture/qam-panel.md`.

//
// No overflow here — the panel branch must not set one. Steam's own `ScrollY`
// class carries `overflow-y: auto` with `overflow-x: hidden` and a 20 px scroll
// padding (`._29WypCpglgRKsR_fMPsoFX`, `css/chunk~2dcc5aaf7.css`), and an inline
// `overflow` shorthand beats both of those axes. The sideways scroll it would
// restore is one Steam clips on purpose: one over-wide row and every focus step
// inside the region would drag the whole pane left and right under the reader.
//
// `overscroll-behavior` is a different property and safe to set: it does not
// name an axis of `overflow`, so it cannot undo Steam's sideways clipping. It
// stops the WHEEL from chaining out of a region that has reached its end —
// measured on device, all three nested scrollers here compute `auto`, so a
// mouse at the bottom of the detail pane went on to scroll Steam's tab panel
// and took the Back row off the top with it. A controller never showed it,
