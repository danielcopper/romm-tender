/**
 * The start-up check's own drift lock, plus what it reports.
 *
 * The lock is the first test: every value the panel imports from `@decky/ui`
 * must be classified — as a search this check asks, as a name it cannot answer
 * for, or as the package's own code. A name in none of the three is the one
 * shape that fails, and it is the shape that matters: an import added tomorrow
 * is a dependency nobody decided about, and the check would go on reporting
 * "everything resolved" while the panel rendered a hole.
 *
 * It sweeps the source rather than naming the files, for the reason
 * `test-utils/componentSources.ts` gives at length: a file missing from a
 * hand-kept list carries no lock at all and cannot be told from one that never
 * drifted.
