/**
 * Reads that two independent stores issue for one ROM at the same moment.
 *
 * A game page has two stores — `bigpicture/panelState.ts` for the info panel,
 * `utils/gameDetailStore.ts` for the play row — and each loads some of the same
 * facts about the same ROM, so opening a page pays for those reads twice. One
 * store is the real answer (#994); until then a read issued while the same read
 * for the same ROM is still in flight joins it instead of opening a second
 * round-trip.
 *
 * **The admission rule.** Everyone awaiting one request is handed the SAME
 * answer, so a call site may join only if its answer cannot change between the
 * moment the first caller issued the read and the moment this caller joins it.
 * Nothing mechanical enforces that — this sentence is the module's whole safety
 * argument, and a new entry below is a claim that it holds for that read at that
 * call site. Only reads, never a write.
 *
 * What the rule excludes:
 *
 * - **The change-driven handlers.** `core_changed` and `metadata` re-read
 *   BECAUSE the thing changed, so joining a read issued before the change hands
 *   them the pre-change answer. Both keep calling `api/backend` directly.
 * - **`get_save_slots` / `is_save_tracking_configured`.** Their one refresh path
 *   (`refreshSlotState` in `bigpicture/panelState.ts`) is also the slot lane's
 *   re-read after a slot switch, delete or copy-to-slot — each of which
 *   dispatches `save_sync` the moment it completes. A post-mutation re-read must
 *   never join a pre-mutation one, so these two are absent from this module
 *   entirely and their duplicate on page open stands.
 *
 * What the rule admits, for the three reads below: both load lanes read them at
 * page open, and the only other paths that re-issue them are the store's three
 * re-derive triggers — `download_complete`, `rom_adopted` and
 * `romm_rom_uninstalled`. None can change a ROM's metadata, its active core, or
 * which firmware files are on disk, so the answer they would join is the answer
 * they would get. A version switch re-keys to a different rom_id, which is a
 * different key here — it shares with the other lane's load for that same new
 * rom_id, and with nothing else.
 *
 * `get_bios_status` needs that argument made twice over, because a BIOS answer
 * is the one of the three that a user action moves within a single page's
 * lifetime: a firmware download or delete empties the firmware cache, and the
 * next read answers differently. What admits it anyway is that no such action
 * ever leads to a read through this module. Every re-read that follows one is
 * change-driven and calls `api/backend` directly — the play row's post-download
 * `refreshBiosStatus`, the `bios` event's own `check_platform_bios`, both
 * stores' core-change handlers, and the info panel's version-switch re-read —
 * and neither store re-runs a LOAD on a `bios` event, so a shared read is never
 * issued after a firmware mutation.
 *
 * The bound on all three: a request is joinable only while it is open, so what
 * a joiner can be handed is an answer read at most one open request ago. That is
 * the page-open pair for the reads below, whose two calls are issued microtasks
 * apart with no await a user action could land in. A read left hanging long
 * enough to span one — an unresponsive server — can still be joined by the next
 * load of the same ROM, which is the residual every entry here carries and the
 * thing to weigh before adding a fourth.
