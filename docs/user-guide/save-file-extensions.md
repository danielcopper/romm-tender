# Save File Extensions

Research results for which save file extensions RetroDECK cores produce, and what our plugin needs to support. This
informs the implementation of [#196](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/196).

!!! warning "Historical — the extension table this page designed no longer exists"

    The plugin held a per-system list of save extensions, and this page is the research behind it. **That list is
    retired.** The plugin now asks the machine which files a game's save consists of, per game and per the emulator
    that will launch it, and reads the answer fresh on every sync — see
    [Save sync coverage](../architecture/save-sync-coverage.md) and
    [ADR-0031](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0031-a-save-is-answered-by-the-emulator-that-writes-it.md).

    Measuring the same systems against that live reading showed the table was wrong in both directions: Amiga has no
    separate save file at all (the writes go into the disk image, so the plugin was searching for a `.nvr` that cannot
    exist), and 3DO's real name carries a version digit (`<rom>.0.srm`) the table never had. Saturn's third extension
    turned out to be console configuration rather than progress, and is no longer synced.

    Keep this page as the record of how the original `.srm`/`.dsv`/`.brm` decision was reached. Do not use it to
    predict what syncs today — the [Save sync support matrix](save-sync-support-matrix.md) is the broader view, and
    your own machine is the authority.

## How RetroArch Save Extensions Work

RetroArch has two save mechanisms:

1. **Standard libretro saves** (`libretro_saves = "true"` in core info): RetroArch handles all file I/O. The extension
   is **hardcoded to `.srm`** (SRAM) and **`.rtc`** (real-time clock). The core exposes memory via
   `RETRO_MEMORY_SAVE_RAM` / `RETRO_MEMORY_RTC`, and RetroArch writes the files. Every core using this mechanism
   produces identical extensions.

2. **Core-managed saves** (`libretro_saves = "false"` or absent): The core handles its own file I/O, writing to
   RetroArch's save directory with custom extensions. RetroArch has no control over these filenames.

This means `.srm`/`.rtc` covers the vast majority of cores. Only a handful of cores use custom extensions.

## RetroDECK Core Inventory

Checked against RetroDECK's installed cores (March 2026). Only cores relevant to save file sync are listed.

### Cores Using Standard `.srm`/`.rtc` (libretro_saves = true)

These cores all produce `.srm` (and optionally `.rtc`). No additional extensions needed.

### Cores With Special Extension Behavior

#### DeSmuME (DS) -- `.dsv`

- `libretro_saves = "true"`, so **default is `.srm`**
- However, DeSmuME has a dual-mode: its `BackupDevice` class can write `.dsv` (DeSmuME's native format) when configured
  in Mednafen-compatibility mode
- The core will also fall back to loading `.sav` files if `.dsv` is not found
- **Action**: Add `.dsv` as platform override for DS, so we pick up saves from users who switched modes

#### Genesis Plus GX (Sega CD) -- `.brm`

- `libretro_saves = "true"` for **cartridge SRAM** (standard `.srm`)
- But Sega CD **BRAM** (backup RAM) is managed by the core separately as `.brm` files
- These include: `cart.brm` (cartridge backup RAM) and region-specific system BRAM (`scd_U.brm`, `scd_E.brm`,
  `scd_J.brm`)
- The per-game BRAM uses the standard rom-name `.brm` pattern
- **Action**: Add `.brm` as platform override for Sega CD

#### Flycast (Dreamcast) -- `.bin`

- No `libretro_saves` field in core info -- uses its own VMU format
- Produces `vmu_save_{A1-D1}.bin` files and `dc_nvmem.bin`
- Multi-slot VMU support (games can produce multiple `.bin` files)
- **Action**: Tracked separately in [#151](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/151). Not included in
  extension expansion.

#### MAME / FBNeo (Arcade) -- `.nv`

- `libretro_saves = "false"` for all MAME/FBNeo cores
- MAME manages its own NVRAM system (writes to `SAVEDIR/mame/NVRAM/`)
- Not using RetroArch's standard save path at all
- **Action**: Not relevant for save sync. MAME saves use a completely different directory structure.

#### gpsp (GBA) -- no libretro_saves

- `libretro_saves = "false"` -- manages its own saves
- In practice, gpsp writes `.sav` files in its own format
- However, mgba/vbam are the recommended GBA cores in RetroDECK
- **Action**: Add `.sav` defensively to GBA overrides for gpsp users

#### mednafen_gba (Beetle GBA) -- custom format

- No `libretro_saves` field -- uses Mednafen's native format
- Can write `.{md5}.sav` and `.{md5}.eep` with MD5 hash in filename
- Has a dual mode: Mednafen method (own files) vs libretro method (`.srm`)
- Rarely used in RetroDECK (mgba is the default)
- **Action**: Not worth supporting the MD5-hashed filenames. Users of this core should use libretro mode.

## Comparison With Other RomM Clients

### Grout (Go client)

Uses a **flat global allowlist** of 11 extensions with no per-platform mapping:

```text
.srm, .sav, .dsv, .mcr, .mcd, .brm, .eep, .sra, .fla, .mpk, .nv
```

This is intentionally broad -- Grout targets multiple CFWs (muOS, NextUI, MinUI) where standalone emulators produce
these formats. For RetroArch-only setups like RetroDECK, most of these are unnecessary.

### Argosy (Android client)

Uses a **per-emulator** mapping:

| Emulator                    | Extensions                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| RetroArch                   | `.srm`, `.sav`                 |
| Mupen64Plus FZ (standalone) | `.sra`, `.eep`, `.fla`, `.mpk` |
| DraStic (standalone DS)     | `.dsv`, `.sav`                 |
| melonDS (standalone)        | `.sav`                         |
| DuckStation (standalone)    | `.mcd`                         |
| MAME                        | `.nv`                          |

Again, standalone emulator formats that don't apply to RetroDECK's RetroArch-based setup.

## Implementation Decision

For Tender (RetroDECK-only):

| Extension                      | Include?                          | Reason                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.srm`                         | **Yes** (already supported)       | Standard RetroArch SRAM                                      |
| `.rtc`                         | **Yes** (already supported)       | Standard RetroArch RTC                                       |
| `.dsv`                         | **Yes** (add as DS override)      | DeSmuME native format                                        |
| `.brm`                         | **Yes** (add as Sega CD override) | Genesis Plus GX Sega CD BRAM                                 |
| `.sav`                         | **Yes** (add to defaults)         | gpsp fallback, DeSmuME fallback, defensive                   |
| `.bin`                         | **No** (separate ticket #151)     | Flycast Dreamcast VMU -- needs special handling              |
| `.eep`, `.sra`, `.fla`, `.mpk` | **No**                            | N64 standalone formats, Mupen64Plus packs into `.srm`        |
| `.mcr`, `.mcd`                 | **No**                            | PSX Mednafen/DuckStation formats, RetroArch cores use `.srm` |
| `.nv`                          | **No**                            | MAME NVRAM, completely different directory structure         |

### System Override Map

Override keys are RetroDECK **system** names (the normalized value from `resolve_system` / `platform_map`), not raw RomM
platform slugs — this keeps the extension lookup aligned with the save directory, cores, and gamelists, which are all
system-keyed.

```python
_DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS = (".srm", ".rtc", ".sav")

_PLATFORM_OVERRIDES = {
    "nds": (".srm", ".rtc", ".sav", ".dsv"),
    "segacd": (".srm", ".rtc", ".sav", ".brm"),
}
```

Adding `.sav` to defaults is conservative but safe -- it ensures we pick up saves from any core that uses `.sav` as an
alternative SRAM format, without false-matching on non-save files.
