# Core and Emulator Selection

## Overview

A RomM game launches through RetroDECK on some **emulator** — most often a **RetroArch libretro core**, but for a few
platforms (PS2, PS3, …) a **standalone emulator** (PCSX2, RPCS3) that ES-DE lists as the working default. Most games use
their platform's default emulator, but the user can pin a different core for a single game (a **per-game** emulator
override) or for a whole platform (a **per-platform** emulator override). This page documents how the plugin decides
which emulator a game uses, where that decision is stored, and how it is applied at launch.

The central rule: **the read-path core equals the launched core.** Whatever core the plugin reports for a game — in the
BIOS-requirement filter, the save-directory name, the save-sync core tag, the core-change warning, the game-detail badge
— is the exact core that game will launch on. A single resolver guarantees that, and the launch command is baked from
the same resolved emulator. The plugin **owns emulator selection end to end**: it reads RetroDECK/ES-DE configuration
for the default emulator, but its own launches never depend on ES-DE's `gamelist.xml` — it neither reads nor writes that
file. The **live `es_systems.xml` is the sole source** for the system-layer default and the picker's emulator list;
there is no bundled snapshot (the curated `core_defaults.json` and its generator were deleted in #1210). What **reads**
that file is the vendored emu-atlas resolver, through `adapters/atlas_catalogue.py` — the plugin's own parser is gone
(#1840). See
[ADR-0011](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0011-per-game-core-override-in-db-applied-via-e-flag.md)

(live `es_systems.xml` as the only source; the default is the first safely-bakeable command), and

(the resolver is what reads it; ES-DE's selections are ignored and its overlays honoured) for the decision records.

### Two emulator kinds: libretro core and standalone

The resolved emulator is a pure value object — `domain.shortcut_data.EmulatorInvocation` — that carries **exactly one**
of two payloads:

- **`kind == "libretro"`** — a RetroArch core, identified by its bare `.so` name (`core_so`). Rendered as the
  `-e "%EMULATOR_RETROARCH% -L <coresdir>/<so>.so %ROM%"` form. This is the overwhelming-majority path.
- **`kind == "standalone"`** — a standalone emulator, identified by its full ES-DE `<command>` text (already ending in
  `%ROM%`, e.g. `%EMULATOR_RPCS3% --no-gui %ROM%`). Baked verbatim into `-e`. RetroDECK resolves `%EMULATOR_*%` and
  substitutes `%ROM%` at launch, the same as the libretro form. This is the standalone-emulator seam
  ([#129](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/129)): a system whose working ES-DE default is a
  standalone emulator (PS2 → PCSX2, PS3 → RPCS3, GameCube/Wii → Dolphin, PSP → PPSSPP, …) launches on that emulator
  instead of a deprecated/absent libretro core.

Both kinds are first-class throughout: the **system default** may be either (whichever ES-DE lists first that the plugin
can bake), and the per-game / per-platform picker lists both — so a pin may name a standalone emulator OR a libretro
core (#1210). A pin is stored as the emulator **LABEL** and resolved through the same classified option list at use
time.

A standalone emulator has **no** libretro `.so`, so the read-path projection reports `core_so = None` and every
`.so`-space consumer degrades exactly as it does for an unconfigured platform (see
[the single read seam](#the-single-read-seam-activecoreresolver)).

## The two override scopes

The plugin owns two **deviations** from the RetroDECK default core. Each stores only the deviation as a core LABEL;
absence means "follow the default."

| Scope            | Stored where                                             | Applies to              | Written by                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Per-game**     | Plugin DB — `roms.emulator_override` (nullable LABEL)    | one ROM (by `rom_id`)   | the plugin (`pin`/`clear`)     |
| **Per-platform** | `settings.json` — `platform_cores` map (`{slug: label}`) | every ROM on a platform | the plugin (`set_system_core`) |

Both overrides are the plugin's own state and live in the plugin's own stores. Neither is written into ES-DE's
`gamelist.xml` — the plugin **never writes that file**. It still **reads** the RetroDECK/ES-DE configuration it does not
own (the live `es_systems.xml` — the system default emulator and the full classified command list the picker offers),
but the per-game and per-platform deviations are layered on top of that read by the plugin itself.

## Storage: the per-game override is a LABEL on the `Rom` aggregate

`roms.emulator_override` is a nullable `TEXT` column added by migration `002_add_emulator_override.sql`. It holds the
core **LABEL** the user picked (e.g. `"Beetle PSX HW"`), exactly as ES-DE displays it — never a resolved `.so` filename.

- **`NULL` = no override** → the game follows the RetroDECK/ES-DE default.
- It anchors on `roms`, not `rom_installs`, so the choice **survives uninstall/reinstall** (per
  [ADR-0007](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0007-rom-retention-identity-anchor.md)).
- Mutations go through the verb-named aggregate methods `Rom.pin_emulator_override(label)` (rejects a blank label) and
  `Rom.clear_emulator_override()`. Only `pin`/`clear` ever write the column; it is **excluded from the sync UPSERT `SET`
  clause**, so a re-sync never wipes a user's pin.

The plugin stores the **deviation** (the LABEL, or `NULL`), not a resolved core. The default and system layers are owned
by RetroDECK/ES-DE and change externally — a RetroDECK update can ship a new default emulator — so a stored resolved
value would go stale. Storing only the deviation keeps the plugin authoritative over exactly the slice it owns and
re-resolves the rest live. The LABEL is turned into an `EmulatorInvocation` (a libretro `.so` **or** a standalone
command) through the live-`es_systems.xml` classified option list at use time
(`domain.emulator_commands.label_to_invocation`) — so a per-game pin may name a standalone emulator, not only a libretro
core (#1210).

## Storage: the per-platform core is a LABEL in `settings.json`

The per-platform core lives in a `platform_cores` map in `settings.json` — `{platform_slug: core_label}` — added at
settings schema version 7 (a `setdefault("platform_cores", {})` migration; `adapters/persistence.py` +
`domain/state_migrations.py`). It holds the same kind of value as the per-game pin: the core **LABEL**, never a resolved
`.so`. An **absent key** means "no per-platform deviation — follow the es_systems default for this platform."

It is an
[ADR-0003](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0003-json-sqlite-persistence-boundary.md)
**bucket-1** value: a flat, user-set, relationship-free intent toggle. So it lives in `settings.json`, **not** SQLite,
and there is **no `Platform` aggregate** — consistent with the `platform_slug`-is-denormalized stance. The map starts
empty: there is no seed and no import from any previously-set ES-DE gamelist core (see
[No migration](#no-migration-re-apply-once)). The plugin reads it through the `PlatformCoreReader` Protocol
(`PlatformCoreReaderAdapter` in `adapters/persistence.py`), which holds the **live** settings dict so a fan-out after a
write resolves the freshly-written value rather than a stale snapshot.

## The single read seam: `ActiveCoreResolver`

`ActiveCoreResolver` (`py_modules/services/active_core_resolver.py`) is the one place that answers "which emulator will
this ROM actually launch with?" It exposes two methods over the **same** three-layer resolution:

- **`active_emulator_for_rom(rom_id) -> EmulatorInvocation | None`** — the **launch-bake seam**. Returns the full
  resolved emulator (libretro core OR standalone), or `None` when the platform has no resolvable emulator at all.
- **`active_core_for_rom(rom_id) -> (core_so, label)`** — the **read-path projection** of the above, kept for the
  `.so`-space consumers. A libretro emulator yields `(core_so, label)`; a **standalone** emulator yields
  `(None, label)`; an unresolvable platform yields `(None, None)`. Consumers already degrade on a `None` core, so a
  standalone launch never breaks them.

The precedence is the invariant:

> **per-game DB `emulator_override` (top) → per-platform `settings.json` `platform_cores` → live es_systems default →
> `None` (plain launch).**

```text
active_emulator_for_rom(rom_id):
  rom = read roms row (platform_slug + emulator_override)  ── one UoW read
  system = resolve_system(rom.platform_slug)               ── platform→system (ADR-0010)
  options = get_emulator_options(system)["options"]        ── every es_systems <command>, classified
  if rom.emulator_override is not None:                    ── layer 1: per-game pin (libretro OR standalone)
      inv = label_to_invocation(options, override)
      if inv is not None:
          return inv
      # stale / un-bakeable per-game label: warn, fall through
  platform_label = get_platform_core(rom.platform_slug)    ── layer 2: per-platform settings.json (libretro OR standalone)
  if platform_label is not None:
      inv = label_to_invocation(options, platform_label)
      if inv is not None:
          return inv
      # stale / un-bakeable per-platform label: warn, fall through
  return get_default_emulator(system)                      ── layer 3: live es_systems default (may be standalone), else None

active_core_for_rom(rom_id):                               ── the .so-space projection
  e = active_emulator_for_rom(rom_id)
  return (None, None) if e is None else (e.core_so, e.label)
```

Layers 1 and 2 resolve their LABEL through `domain.emulator_commands.label_to_invocation`, which finds the option
carrying that label and renders it into an `EmulatorInvocation` **only if it is bakeable** — so a pin may name a
standalone emulator or a libretro core, and a label that is unknown, un-bakeable, or `needs_setup` reads as "this pin no
longer resolves" and degrades to the next layer with a WARNING (never a bogus `None.so`). The system-layer fallback is
`AtlasCatalogueAdapter.get_default_emulator(system)` (`adapters/atlas_catalogue.py`): **the first safely-bakeable
command in the live `es_systems.xml` document order** (see
[Standalone-emulator selection](#standalone-emulator-selection-first-safely-bakeable)), which may itself be standalone
(PCSX2, RPCS3, Dolphin, …) or libretro. **Only** the live file decides it — no bundled snapshot — and **no gamelist
selection ever moves it**: the resolver reads the gamelist and states which entry a per-game `<altemulator>` or a
system-level `<alternativeEmulator>` promotes, and the adapter discards that by sorting on the shipped position, so the
gamelist stays off every plugin launch path. When nothing is bakeable, or the catalogue cannot be read, it returns
`None` and the caller bakes the plain RetroDECK launch.

### Standalone-emulator selection: first safely-bakeable

Selection is **data-derived from the live `es_systems.xml` alone** — there is no curated snapshot. The pure kernel
`domain/emulator_commands.py` classifies each of a system's ES-DE `<command>` entries into an `EmulatorOption` (`label`,
`kind`, `core_so`, `command`, `status`, `reason`), and `select_default_option` returns **the first `bakeable` command in
document order**. ES-DE already lists a system's emulators in preference order, so ES-DE's own preference picks the
default — no plugin curation, no per-system table.

**Document order is recovered, not taken.** The resolver states its entries in _effective_ order, where a gamelist
promotion may put a later entry first, and carries each entry's shipped position as `declared_index`. The adapter sorts
on that position before classifying, so the list handed to `select_default_option`, `label_to_invocation`,
`resolve_platform_label` and `options_to_payload` is already in declared order and every one of them keeps its rule
unchanged. The indices are ascending but need not start at 0 or be dense — ES-DE's own walk lets an empty-text
`<command>` hold a position without yielding an entry, and drops a duplicate label entirely — so neither `entries[0]`
nor "index 0 exists" is assumed. An entry with **no** declared position sorts last; that is the resolver's derived
enumeration for a catalogue-less arrangement, and such an entry carries an empty command, which rule 3 below reads as
`no_rom_target`.

A command is `bakeable` only when it is a real emulator invocation the plugin can carry verbatim into a Steam shortcut's
`-e`. `classify_command` applies these rules in order, first match wins:

1. contains `%INJECT%` → `needs_setup` (`"inject"`) — needs ES-DE to generate a sidecar first (Vita3K, Xemu);
2. contains `%ENABLESHORTCUTS%` or `%EMULATOR_OS-SHELL%` → `unbakeable` (`"shortcut_script"`);
3. does not end in `%ROM%` → `unbakeable` (`"no_rom_target"`) — trailing args after `%ROM%` break the bake;
4. contains `"` or `\;` → `unbakeable` (`"quoting"`);
5. any placeholder outside the whitelist (`%EMULATOR_*%`, `%ROM%`, `%CORE_RETROARCH%`, `%GAMEDIR%`, `%GAMEDIRRAW%`,
   `%ROMPATH%`, `%BASENAME%`, `%FILENAME%`, `%ROMRAW%`, `%STARTDIR%`) → `unbakeable` (`"unknown_placeholder"`);
6. contains `%STARTDIR%` → `unbakeable` (`"startdir"`) — RetroDECK's `run_game.sh` parses-but-drops it, so a baked
   command would launch from the wrong directory (a v1 limitation);
7. otherwise `bakeable`.

This is why a system whose first command is a fragile shortcut form (`%ENABLESHORTCUTS% %EMULATOR_OS-SHELL% %ROM%`)
skips it and bakes the next command (the direct `--no-gui` launch): the shortcut form is `unbakeable`, so
`select_default_option` walks past it. A leading `env VAR=val …` prefix (the GameCube/Wii Dolphin form) is accepted as a
standalone invocation. The kind is `libretro` when the command matches the strict RetroArch shape
(`%EMULATOR_RETROARCH% -L %CORE_RETROARCH%/<core>_libretro.so %ROM%`), else `standalone`.

**Existence probe (a bakeable standalone whose emulator is not installed → `needs_setup` `not_installed`).** RetroDECK
lists more standalone emulators in `es_systems.xml` than it bundles, so a system's bakeable default could name an
emulator that is not on disk (Ryubing on `switch`, any un-installed external component) — baking it produces a shortcut
that dies in ~0.4 s. To prevent that regression the catalogue adapter asks an injected probe backed by
`es_find_rules.xml` (`adapters/es_find_rules.py` — the resolver states the emulator a command names, never where its
binary lives): it maps a standalone command's `%EMULATOR_<NAME>%` token to the find-rule entry, checks whether any of
that entry's `staticpath` locations exist on disk (mapping the sandbox `/app` and `/var/{data,config}` prefixes to their
host paths, glob-aware), and hands the verdict to the pure `downgrade_if_not_installed(option, installed)` rule — which
turns a bakeable **standalone** whose emulator is absent into `needs_setup` with reason `not_installed`. It then drops
out of `select_default_option` (the system plain-launches, as it did before #1210) and shows disabled in the picker. The
probe is **absence-only** — it downgrades only on positive evidence that a RetroDECK component (`retrodeck/components/…`
or `retrodeck/external_components/…`) is missing; a `systempath`-only emulator (binary on RetroDECK's sandbox `PATH`,
not visible from outside), an emulator with no find rule, and the whole `es_find_rules.xml`-unreadable case are all
assumed installed, so it never falsely downgrades. Libretro is always installed (RetroArch ships with RetroDECK), so
libretro options are never downgraded. See [ADR-0020](../adr/0020-live-es-systems-emulator-resolution.md) §2.

`get_emulator_options(system)` returns `{"available": bool, "options": [EmulatorOption, ...]}`. **`available` is `False`
whenever nothing could be established**, which is five cases: no installation was detected at all; the resolver raised;
or the catalogue answer carries one of the four `emulator-catalogue-*` refusals — the arrangement ships no catalogue,
the resolver has not located one, the one it has could not be read, or only part of it is readable — or
`catalogue-invalid`, a file ES-DE refuses its whole load on (usually a typo in the user's own `custom_systems` overlay).
The picker surfaces all of them as "Emulator list unavailable" rather than an empty list it cannot distinguish from a
system the frontend knows no emulator for; the launch degrades to plain. An empty list carrying none of those codes is
that real "knows none", and `emulator-catalogue-exclusive` is not a refusal at all: a custom `es_systems.xml` declaring
itself the whole catalogue gives a complete answer, merely a small one. The test is the codes and never an empty caveat
list — a broken installation states health findings on every answer it gives. `options_to_payload` projects the list to
the frontend picker shape (`{label, kind, core_so, is_default, bakeable, reason}`): bakeable entries are clickable, the
default is marked, and `needs_setup` / `unbakeable` entries are disabled with their reason. See
[ADR-0020](../adr/0020-live-es-systems-emulator-resolution.md) — including the 27 default flips this selection rule
produces relative to the old first-libretro default.

Adding a new standalone system needs **no plugin change** — the moment a RetroDECK update lists its emulator in
`es_systems.xml` in preference order, the plugin's default follows.

**Every per-game core read consumer draws from this one seam**, so the launch core cannot diverge from any derived
value:

| Consumer                                      | What it uses the core for                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FirmwareService` / game-detail BIOS check    | which BIOS files the active core requires (optional vs req) |
| `RomInfoService` (saves) → RetroArch corename | the sort-by-core save subdirectory name                     |
| `SyncEngine` (saves) core tag                 | the per-core save-sync identity                             |
| `StatusService.check_core_change`             | detect a core change since the last save sync               |
| `GameDetailService` → CPU badge / Active Core | the core shown on the game detail page                      |

A pinned per-game or per-platform label that no longer resolves (the core was removed by a RetroDECK update) is **never
fatal**: the resolver logs a WARNING and degrades to the next layer (the per-platform core, then the es_systems
default). No consumer ever sees a bogus `.so`.

## Application: baking `-e` into `launch_options`

Per
[ADR-0009](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0009-launcher-pure-exec-wrapper-baked-launch-options.md),
the launcher is a pure `exec "$@"` wrapper and the full launch command lives in the Steam shortcut's `launch_options`.
The pure seam `domain.shortcut_data.resolve_emulator_invocation(rom, emulator)` takes the resolved `EmulatorInvocation`
and renders the invocation:

- **libretro** invocation → the RetroArch `-e` form:

  ```text
  flatpak run net.retrodeck.retrodeck -e "%EMULATOR_RETROARCH% -L /var/config/retroarch/cores/<core>.so %ROM%"
  ```

- **standalone** invocation → the emulator's full ES-DE command baked verbatim:

  ```text
  flatpak run net.retrodeck.retrodeck -e "%EMULATOR_RPCS3% --no-gui %ROM%"
  ```

- `emulator is None` → the plain `flatpak run net.retrodeck.retrodeck`.

`%EMULATOR_*%` and `%ROM%` stay as ES-DE placeholders — RetroDECK's `run_game.sh` resolves and single-quotes them at
launch, so a ROM path with spaces or parens is handled. For the libretro form, only the in-sandbox cores directory
(`/var/config/retroarch/cores`) is baked literally; ES-DE's `%CORE_RETROARCH%` variable is **not** expanded through
`-e`, so the plugin bakes the resolved path itself (a standalone command carries no `%CORE_RETROARCH%`, so it bakes
as-is). The `-e` flag makes RetroDECK skip its gamelist lookup entirely, which is why a baked emulator applies for any
filename (see
[Why the plugin always bakes the core, never the gamelist](#why-the-plugin-always-bakes-the-core-never-the-gamelist)).

**Always `-e`.** Per
[ADR-0012](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0012-plugin-owns-core-selection-always-e-no-gamelist.md),
every installed ROM bakes its **full resolved active emulator** through `-e` — the per-game pin, the per-platform core,
the es_systems libretro default, or a standalone emulator, whichever the resolver returns. The plain `flatpak run`
launch is **not** the "no override" case any more; it is reserved for the single fallback where the resolver yields
`None` (a platform with no resolvable default at all). Baking the default for every ROM is what lets the plugin own
launch selection completely: a launch that is _not_ `-e` would let RetroDECK consult the gamelist, re-coupling the
plugin to ES-DE's state. The cost is that a RetroDECK update changing a platform's default core needs a **Force Full
Sync** to re-bake — see [A frozen default needs a Force Full Sync](#a-frozen-default-needs-a-force-full-sync).

### The three bake sites

`launch_options` is written wherever a shortcut's command is (re)built. All three resolve the ROM's **full active
emulator** through the same `ActiveCoreResolver.active_emulator_for_rom` seam and pass the `EmulatorInvocation` into
`resolve_emulator_invocation`, so the read-path core and the launched emulator cannot diverge:

| Bake site                                            | When it runs                             | How it resolves the emulator                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ShortcutLaunchResolver` → `do_build_core_overrides` | every sync (preview + apply)             | each ROM through `active_emulator_for_rom` → `{rom_id: EmulatorInvocation}` for the bake |
| `DownloadService` → `_resolve_bound_app_id`          | on download-complete (install/reinstall) | the ROM through `active_emulator_for_rom` in the same flow                               |
| `MigrationService` → `_build_relaunch_items`         | on RetroDECK-home migration              | each relocated ROM through `active_emulator_for_rom`                                     |

The download-complete bake is the one that re-applies a pin after reinstall — the exact path `roms` storage was chosen
to protect. Each site bakes `-e` for every ROM that resolves to a concrete emulator (libretro or standalone), and the
plain launch only when the resolver returns `None`. A stale LABEL is handled inside the resolver (warn + degrade), so no
bake site ever emits `None.so`.

## Multi-disc selection

A multi-disc game (a PS1 RPG across four CDs, say) installs as a folder of disc images. The same bake that carries the
core also carries **which disc launches** — a second per-game deviation that follows the core override's structure point
for point. The decision record is
[ADR-0014](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0014-per-game-disc-selection-in-db-applied-as-bake-time-launch-path-override.md);
the user-facing guide is
[Picking a Disc for Multi-Disc Games](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/user-guide/managing-games.md#picking-a-disc-for-multi-disc-games).

### Storage: the disc pick is a basename on the `Rom` aggregate

`roms.selected_disc` is a nullable `TEXT` column added by migration `004_add_selected_disc.sql`. It holds the
**basename** of the disc the user pinned (e.g. `"Example Quest - Second Journey (USA) (Disc 2).cue"`), never a resolved
absolute path and never a disc index.

- **`NULL` = no selection** → the ROM follows the **default**: the install's `.m3u` when `file_path` is one (the
  in-emulator disc-swap default), else the first enumerated disc.
- It anchors on `roms`, not `rom_installs`, so the pick **survives uninstall/reinstall and RetroDECK-home migration**
  (per
  [ADR-0007](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0007-rom-retention-identity-anchor.md))
  — the disc folder is gone while uninstalled, but the basename re-resolves the moment it returns.
- Mutations go through the verb-named aggregate methods `Rom.pin_selected_disc(filename)` (rejects a blank filename) and
  `Rom.clear_selected_disc()`. Only `pin`/`clear` ever write the column (`SqliteRomRepository.set_selected_disc`); it is
  **excluded from the sync UPSERT `SET` clause** — the same `_SYNC_COLUMNS` tuple that omits `emulator_override` omits
  `selected_disc` — so a re-sync never wipes the pick.

The plugin stores the **basename** because the absolute path changes across uninstall/reinstall and home migration (a
stored path would go stale) and a positional index would silently re-point if a disc file were added, removed, or
renamed. The basename re-resolves to the same disc whenever it is present and cleanly registers as **stale** (→ default

- WARNING) when it is not.

### Disc identity vs the live accept-list

Enumerating a ROM's discs needs two different facts kept separate:

- **Disc identity is format-semantic and hardcoded** — `domain/disc_formats.py` defines
  `DISC_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS = {.cue, .chd, .iso}`, the irreducible set of launchable disc-image containers. A `.bin` is a
  **sidecar** (owned by its `.cue`, never launched directly) and an `.m3u` is a **playlist**; both are excluded simply
  by not being in the set. The disc unit is the `.cue`/`.chd`/`.iso` itself, never the `.bin`.
- **The per-system accept-list is a capability and read live** —
  `AtlasCatalogueAdapter.get_supported_extensions(system)` (`adapters/atlas_catalogue.py`) returns the system's
  es_systems `<extension>` set, lowercased, threaded into the resolver through the `SystemSupportedExtensionsFn`
  Protocol, exactly as `system_supports_m3u` is read for the `.m3u` gate
  ([ADR-0013](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0013-platform-gated-m3u-via-es-systems.md)).

Enumeration keeps the files whose extension is in **the intersection** of the two, so a disc the emulator cannot launch
on this system is never offered. es_systems alone cannot supply disc identity — it is a flat accept-list with no
per-token role metadata, so it lists `.cue`, `.bin`, and `.m3u` identically and cannot say which is the disc. When
es_systems is unavailable, enumeration falls back to the full disc set rather than intersecting to nothing.

### The read seam: `DiscLaunchResolver`

`DiscLaunchResolver` (`py_modules/services/disc_launch_resolver.py`) is the single place that answers "which file will
this multi-disc ROM actually launch with?", mirroring `ActiveCoreResolver`. It scans the install directory recursively
(the file-lister Protocol), reads the live accept-list, enumerates the discs (`domain/disc_selection.enumerate_discs`),
and resolves the persisted `selected_disc` over them (`domain/disc_selection.resolve_launch_path`):

```text
resolve_for_install(install, selected_disc):
  discs = enumerate_discs(scan(install.rom_dir), supported_extensions(install.system))
  path =
    if len(discs) < 2:                    ── not multi-disc → file_path unchanged
        install.file_path
    elif selected_disc names a disc:      ── valid pin
        that disc's path
    else:                                 ── NULL, or a stale pin (warn + degrade)
        install.file_path if it ends .m3u else discs[0].path   ── the default
  return folder_boot_root(path, install.rom_dir) or path   ── folder-boot override (ADR-0019)
```

A **non-multi-disc ROM resolves to its own `file_path`** — zero behavior change for the overwhelming majority of games.
A **stale pin** (the selected disc no longer present) degrades to the default with a WARNING, never fatal, exactly like
`ActiveCoreResolver`'s stale-label handling. Crucially, the resolver **never rewrites `file_path`**: it returns the path
to bake, and `file_path`-derived values (save path, core, displayed filename) stay stable — the same bake-time
path-override layering the `-e` core override uses.

### Folder-boot launch target

Some systems boot a game **directory**, not the nested launch file. A PS3 game installs as a folder whose payload is
`…/PS3_GAME/USRDIR/EBOOT.BIN`, and `detect_launch_file` picks that EBOOT as `file_path` — correct as the launch _file_
identity, but RPCS3's directory-boot rejects it and wants the folder that contains `PS3_GAME`
([#1212](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/1212)). Two things change together for such a game — the
baked **path** and the baked **invocation form** — because they are decided from the same layout fact.

**The path.** A bake-time path override, layered **after** disc resolution in the same `resolve_bake_path` seam:
`folder_boot_root(path, install.rom_dir)` (`domain/rom_files.py`) strips a hardcoded `FOLDER_BOOT_MARKERS` run
(`PS3_GAME/USRDIR/EBOOT.BIN`, matched case-sensitively) from the resolved path and returns the game root, guarded so it
fires only when `rom_dir` is set and the derived root stays inside `rom_dir` (a bare EBOOT in the shared system dir
never bakes that shared dir). Because it triggers only when the resolved path still carries the marker, it composes with
disc resolution — a resolved disc path (`…(Disc 2).cue`) has no marker, so a multi-disc ROM is never folder-stripped,
and the folder rule applies only when disc resolution returned `file_path`.

**The invocation form.** RetroDECK's `run_game.sh` reinterprets any directory `%ROM%` as an ES-DE "directory as a file"
(`game="$game/$(basename "$game")"`, `run_game.sh:63-67`), so the standalone `-e "%EMULATOR_RPCS3% --no-gui %ROM%"` form
handed a folder points RPCS3 at a nonexistent `…/<Game>/<Game>` and never boots. A folder-boot standalone is therefore
baked as a **direct sandbox invocation** that bypasses `run_game.sh`:
`flatpak run --command=<launcher> net.retrodeck.retrodeck <args> "<folder>"`, running the emulator's own launcher inside
the sandbox. `ActiveCoreResolver.active_emulator_for_rom` makes this rewrite: when the resolved emulator is a standalone
and the ROM's install is a folder-boot layout (same `folder_boot_root` fact), it resolves the emulator's sandbox
launcher via the `SandboxLauncherFn` seam (`EsFindRulesAdapter.resolve_sandbox_launcher` → the
`/app/retrodeck/components/<x>/…` component path) and returns an `EmulatorInvocation.direct`;
`resolve_emulator_invocation` renders the `--command=` form, stripping `%EMULATOR_*%` + `%ROM%` down to the middle args
(`--no-gui`). A libretro emulator, a non-folder install, or an unresolvable launcher leave the standard `run_game` `-e`
form untouched.

`RomInstall.file_path` stays the EBOOT (the [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-rom-install-launch-file-and-rom-dir.md) anchor), so
save-path, core, and displayed-filename derivations are untouched. Both overrides live in the two shared seams
(`resolve_bake_path` for the path, `active_emulator_for_rom` for the invocation), so **every** bake site (the three
below plus the download-complete, core set/clear, and startup-reconcile bakes) inherits them with no call-site edits,
and a PS3 ROM synced before this change self-heals on its next bake. See
[ADR-0019](../adr/0019-folder-as-launch-target.md).

### The same three bake sites — disc path composes with the core

The three sites that re-bake the core override re-bake the disc path through this seam, and the two compose: the disc
resolver yields the **path**, `ActiveCoreResolver` yields the **`EmulatorInvocation`**, and
`resolve_emulator_invocation(rom, emulator)` + `build_launch_options(invocation, disc_path)` fold them into one command
— a per-game core (or standalone emulator) and a pinned disc on the same shortcut coexist.

| Bake site                                                                        | How it resolves the disc path                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ShortcutLaunchResolver` (`do_scan_installed_paths` / `do_read_installed_paths`) | each installed ROM through `resolve_for_install` → `{rom_id: bake_path}` for the bake     |
| `DownloadService._resolve_bound_app_id`                                          | the freshly-installed ROM through `resolve_for_install` → re-applies the pin on reinstall |
| `MigrationService._build_relaunch_items`                                         | each relocated ROM through `resolve_for_install` against the moved install directory      |

### The picker callables

Two service methods on `DiscService` (`py_modules/services/disc.py`) drive the inline `DiscSelector` dropdown on the
game detail page:

- **`get_disc_selection(rom_id)`** reports `{multi_disc: false}` for an unknown, not-installed, single-file, or
  fewer-than-two-disc ROM (the frontend renders no picker), else `{multi_disc: true, discs: [...], selected, default}`.
  Read-only over the local filesystem; the no-picker answers are normal responses, not failures.
- **`select_disc(rom_id, filename)`** pins a disc (or clears to the default with `filename = null`). An unknown filename
  is a hard `not_found` failure and **nothing is written**; a non-multi-disc ROM is `unsupported`; a not-installed ROM
  is `not_installed` — all in the canonical `{success: false, reason, message}` shape. On success it persists the pick
  via the pin-only `set_selected_disc` write path, bakes the new disc path **folded over the ROM's full active core**,
  and returns the fresh `launch_options` + the now-effective `selected` for the frontend to confirm-set on the live
  shortcut. So the picker's selection and the baked launch command cannot diverge.

## Set, clear, and the confirm-before-toast flow

### Per-game (`CoreService`)

The frontend CPU-button menu on the game detail page drives two backend callables:

- **`set_game_core(rom_id, label)`** resolves the LABEL to a **bakeable `EmulatorInvocation` (libretro or standalone)
  first**, via `label_to_invocation` against the ROM platform's classified command list. A label that does not resolve
  to a bakeable emulator — unknown, `needs_setup`, or otherwise un-bakeable — is a **hard failure**: the canonical
  `{success: False, reason: "core_unavailable", message}` shape is returned and **nothing is written**, so the DB never
  holds a label no consumer can bake. On success it `pin`s the override, then re-bakes and returns the new
  `launch_options` (the `-e` override form) + the bound `app_id` for an installed ROM.
- **`clear_game_core(rom_id)`** (triggered by picking the **default-marked core** in the menu) `clear`s the override to
  `NULL`, then re-resolves the ROM's **full active core** through `ActiveCoreResolver` and bakes _that_ — the
  per-platform core or es_systems default, in `-e` form, **not** an unconditional plain launch. Because the plugin
  always bakes `-e`, "follow the default" still means baking a concrete core; the plain launch appears only when the
  platform resolves to `(None, None)`. There is no separate "Reset" item — selecting the default-marked entry is the
  clear path; any other entry pins that core.

For an installed + bound ROM the response carries `launch_options` + `app_id`; the frontend then **awaits
`setLaunchOptionsConfirmed`** (the fire-then-poll `AppDetails` confirm from
[ADR-0009](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0009-launcher-pure-exec-wrapper-baked-launch-options.md))
**before toasting success**. If the confirm fails, a distinct "Core saved — restart Steam to apply" toast shows and the
**DB row is kept** — the next migration/re-sync re-bakes from the pin. An uninstalled or unbound ROM has no live
shortcut to update: the pin still lands, `launch_options`/`app_id` come back `None`, and the override applies on the
next download/sync.

### Per-platform (`CoreService.set_system_core`)

The platform detail's **Change core** button — a `ButtonItem` opening the same context menu as the game-detail picker,
so standalone emulators and disabled un-bakeable entries render identically (#1210) — calls
**`set_system_core(platform_slug, core_label)`**:

1. It writes the choice into `settings["platform_cores"]` — storing the LABEL under the slug, or popping the slug when
   the label is empty (revert to the es_systems default) — and persists `settings.json` through the injected
   `SettingsPersister`. The es_systems cache is reset so the next resolution re-reads from disk.
2. It then **fans out a re-bake**: it iterates every ROM on the platform and, for each that is **installed and
   shortcut-bound** but does **not** carry a per-game `emulator_override` (the pin wins over the platform default),
   resolves the ROM's full active core and appends `{app_id, launch_options}` to a `rebake_items` list. ROMs with a
   per-game pin, uninstalled ROMs, and unbound ROMs are skipped — they have nothing live to rewrite, or their pin
   already wins.
3. It re-checks BIOS against the newly chosen core and returns `{success, bios_status, rebake_items}`.

The frontend confirm-sets each `rebake_items` entry on its live Steam shortcut the same way the per-game flow does, so a
per-platform core change applies **immediately** to every installed game on the platform — no sync required. Because the
`PlatformCoreReaderAdapter` holds the live settings dict, the fan-out resolves the value just written rather than a
stale snapshot.

The Library page's platform detail reads its core through **`get_system_core_info(platform_slug)`**, a read of its own
rather than a slice of another payload: `get_platform_core_info` is keyed by ROM and layers that ROM's own pin on top,
and the `get_firmware_status` overview carries no entry for a platform it has nothing to say about, so neither can
answer for a platform the user has merely focused. It costs one ES-DE options read and a `settings.json` lookup, opens
no Unit of Work, and is issued once per selection.

Its **`active_core_label`**, and the identically-named field `get_firmware_status` still carries per platform, are both
`domain.emulator_commands.resolve_platform_label` — the platform-level projection of the read-path precedence: the
per-platform override (`platform_cores`) when it is set and still resolves to a bakeable emulator, else the es_systems
**default emulator** label (the first bakeable command — libretro _or_ standalone). One function, so the two readers
cannot drift; a stale override degrades to the default rather than naming an emulator that would not launch, and a
standalone default reads its standalone label rather than the libretro system default. It is intentionally distinct from
the firmware payload's `active_core` (`core_so`), which stays the **libretro** system default the BIOS filter keys on
(standalone-default BIOS accuracy is deferred by ADR-0020).

## Why the plugin always bakes the core, never the gamelist

ES-DE stores core choices in `gamelist.xml` — a per-game `<altemulator>` element and a system-level
`<alternativeEmulator>`. The plugin does **not** use that file for its own launches at all (it neither reads nor writes
it), for reasons grounded in on-device testing:

1. **RetroDECK's gamelist lookup is metacharacter-fragile.** When the plugin's Steam shortcut launches a ROM with a
   plain `flatpak run` command, RetroDECK's `run_game.sh` matches the ROM path against the gamelist using an **awk `~`
   regex**. Any regex metacharacter in the filename (`(USA)`, `(Disc 1)`, `[!]`, …) breaks the match, and the per-game
   `<altemulator>` is silently dropped. This is upstream bug
   [#210](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/210) /
   [RetroDECK#1358](https://github.com/RetroDECK/RetroDECK/issues/1358). (ES-DE's _own_ UI resolves `<altemulator>`
   itself and bypasses the awk — which is why a core choice can look like it works when launched from ES-DE but not from
   the plugin's shortcut.)
2. **`-e` bypasses the lookup.** RetroDECK's `-e` flag sets the emulator invocation directly and skips the gamelist awk
   block, so the baked core applies regardless of filename. The plugin bakes the resolved core into `-e` for **every**
   installed ROM and is no longer coupled to either the awk bug or ES-DE's folder-collapse display quirks.
3. **A plain launch re-couples the plugin to ES-DE.** A non-`-e` launch lets RetroDECK consult the gamelist itself, so a
   core a user set inside ES-DE's UI would silently affect the plugin's launch — diverging from the BIOS badge, the
   per-core save path, and the core-change warning that all follow the plugin's resolver. Baking `-e` for every ROM
   ([ADR-0012](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0012-plugin-owns-core-selection-always-e-no-gamelist.md))
   closes that path: the plugin owns core selection end to end, and an ES-DE-set core never reaches a plugin launch.

Writing the gamelist is dropped for the same ownership reason: `gamelist.xml` is ES-DE's strict-parser-hostile,
multi-root-tolerant file, and the per-platform deviation that once lived there now lives in the plugin's own
`settings.json`. There is **no gamelist write** on any plugin path.

### No migration, re-apply once

There is **no migration** from any old gamelist model. A per-game core previously written to `gamelist.xml` is not
imported (per
[ADR-0011](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/blob/main/docs/adr/0011-per-game-core-override-in-db-applied-via-e-flag.md)),
and a per-platform core previously set as a system-level `<alternativeEmulator>` is **not** imported into
`platform_cores` either — `platform_cores` starts empty. This is by design: a gamelist-import path would revive the
multi-root-XML parse failures and folder-collapse ambiguity the plugin-owned model was chosen to avoid. Re-apply any
per-platform core once through the platform detail's Change core button and it sticks from then on.

### A frozen default needs a Force Full Sync

Because the es_systems default is baked literally into every shortcut, a RetroDECK update that ships a **new default
core for a platform** does **not** take effect on a normal sync — a normal sync skips platforms whose ROM set is
unchanged, so the previously-baked default survives. A **Force Full Sync** re-bakes every shortcut and picks up the new
default. A core the user sets through the plugin (per-game pin or per-platform picker) re-bakes immediately, so only an
externally-changed RetroDECK default carries this caveat.

## RetroDECK is the V1 target

The `-e` flag, the `%EMULATOR_RETROARCH%` / `%ROM%` placeholders, and the `/var/config/retroarch/cores` path are
**RetroDECK-adapter concerns**, isolated at the single seam `resolve_emulator_invocation`. RetroDECK is the supported
launcher for V1 — this is the correct V1 shape, not a placeholder. The per-ROM **selection** (which emulator does this
ROM resolve to?) is a service-layer read; the seam only **renders** the chosen `EmulatorInvocation` into a command
string. Standalone-emulator support ([#129](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/129)) is the first
half of the multi-emulator lift: a standalone emulator is still launched **through RetroDECK's `-e`**, so the RetroDECK
flatpak invocation remains the single seam — only the `-e` payload changed (a verbatim ES-DE command instead of the
RetroArch `-L` form). The remaining lift ([#918](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/918)) — a
non-RetroDECK launcher behind a `Frontend`-style port — is net-new work and is not built until a second launcher is
concrete.

The **core picker now lists standalone emulators alongside libretro cores** (#1210 / ADR-0020) — you _can_ choose
standalone PCSX2 vs the LRPS2 libretro core in the UI, at both per-game and per-platform scope. One follow-up stays out
of scope for the standalone seam: **BIOS badge / save-sync** for a standalone system read `active_core = None` and
degrade — the launch works (BIOS already present on-device), but badge accuracy and standalone save-sync are separate
efforts.
