# Tender { .hero-title }

A [Decky Loader](https://decky.xyz/) plugin that syncs your self-hosted [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) ROM
library into Steam as Non-Steam shortcuts. Games launch through [RetroDECK](https://retrodeck.net/).

- Browse your entire RomM library directly from Steam's Gaming Mode
- Download ROMs on-demand with cover art, hero banners, logos, and metadata
- Manage BIOS files for systems that require them
- Sync save files between devices through your RomM server

!!! note "Pre-1.0 (v0.x)"

    The feature set isn't complete yet. Save sync covers standard cartridge saves; the memory-card systems —
    PlayStation, PS2, Dreamcast, GameCube, PSP, 3DS — don't sync their saves yet
    ([support matrix](user-guide/save-sync-support-matrix.md)).

!!! info "How this is built"

    The code is written by an AI coding agent working under my direction. The architecture, the design decisions
    and the review are mine, and changes are smoke-tested on real hardware before they ship.
