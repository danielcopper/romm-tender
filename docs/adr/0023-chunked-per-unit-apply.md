# The per-unit apply is chunked into durable per-chunk commits

## Status

Accepted. Tracked under [#1025](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/1025). Extends
[ADR-0006](0006-narrow-unit-of-work-scope.md) (the narrow write Unit of Work each chunk commits under) and the
group-aware apply of [ADR-0021](0021-sibling-group-one-shortcut-binding-active-version.md) (chunks cut only at
sibling-group boundaries, so a game's dumps never straddle two commits). It carries the #1041 run/unit ack identity and
the #1052 heartbeat-timeout late-ack recovery down to chunk granularity.

## Context

The library apply emits one `sync_apply_unit` event per platform/collection unit, carrying that unit's whole collapsed
shortcut list, then waits for the frontend's `report_unit_results` ack before committing the unit's `roms` rows in a
single write UoW. On small libraries this is fine. On large ones it is a single point of catastrophic loss.

[#797](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/797) is the field data. A platform unit of **3084
shortcuts** was emitted in one event. The frontend applied them at the CEF-safe 50 ms cadence — about 24 minutes of work
— and roughly 24 minutes in, `steamwebhelper` died of an internal out-of-memory (a `SIGTRAP` inside `libcef.so`, the
process image near 4 GB). No `report_unit_results` ever arrived, so the backend committed **nothing**: the entire unit's
24 minutes of shortcut creation was forfeit, and the next sync started it over from zero. Two compounding costs made the
single emit fragile:

- **Payload size.** One unit's shortcut list is a multi-MB JSON blob (~3 MB at 3084 entries) pushed through the
  size-limited `decky.emit` WebSocket bridge in one frame, and the frontend closure holds the whole list live for the
  entire apply.
- **Blast radius.** The commit is all-or-nothing at unit granularity, so any crash, cancel, or heartbeat timeout
  anywhere in those 24 minutes discards the whole unit.

## Decision

**A unit's emitted shortcuts are split into fixed-size chunks that are emitted, acked, and committed one at a time, so a
mid-unit failure forfeits only the in-flight chunk.**

- **Chunk size is a fixed 200** (`_APPLY_CHUNK_SIZE`, `services/library/sync_orchestrator.py`). At ~200 entries a
  chunk's payload is ~200 KB (comfortably under the bridge ceiling) and its apply is ~2 minutes at the 50 ms cadence —
  the crash blast radius drops from 24+ minutes to ~2. It is not configurable (see Alternatives).
- **Chunks cut only at sibling-group boundaries** (`domain/sync_chunking.py::build_unit_chunks`, pure). The collapsed
  emit list is group-clustered (ADR-0021); a chunk greedy-fills to 200 but **overflows to finish a group** so a
  multi-version game's entries never straddle two chunks — and therefore two commits. A keyless entry (a legacy or solo
  ROM) is its own singleton run, so a cut before or after it is always legal. Groups fetched but never emitted (a
  partial view's grandfathered siblings) plus any unmatched leftover ROMs ride chunk 0's commit row set; an empty unit
  yields exactly one empty chunk, so the empty round-trip and its unbound-row commit survive.
- **Each chunk is a durable commit.** `sync_apply_unit` now also carries `chunk_index` / `chunk_count` / `chunk_offset`
  / `unit_total`, and `shortcuts` is the chunk slice. On the ack the reporter commits only that chunk's `roms` rows —
  the same group-aware two-pass write it already did per unit (every fetched sibling upserted, only representatives
  bound; Rom row before `rom_metadata`, FK-safe; the ADR-0006 narrow UoW), now over a row subset. A committed chunk is
  crash-safe on its own; the next chunk emits only after it commits.
- **Reuse the existing event and callable, extended in place.** `sync_apply_unit` gains four fields and
  `report_unit_results(map, run_id, unit_id, chunk_index)` gains the chunk index. No new `sync_apply_chunk` event and no
  new ack callable were added — a chunk is the unit at a finer grain, so the chunk protocol is the unit protocol.
  Frontend and backend ship in the same PR, the callable-manifest and event-parity gates keep them in lock-step, and
  there is no half-wired dead surface (a new event with no listener, or a callable with no caller, would fail those
  gates).
- **Ack identity is chunk-scoped.** The #1041 identity check (`run_id` == `current_sync_id`, `unit_id` ==
  `active_unit_id`) gains `chunk_index` == `active_chunk_index`. The orchestrator stamps `active_chunk_index` before
  each chunk's emit and clears it at commit, cancel, or timeout (moved into the abandoned-chunk stash below), so a late
  ack for a superseded chunk can never commit against a newer one — the same defense the run/unit identity already gave,
  at chunk granularity.
- **Late-ack recovery is per chunk, via an abandoned-chunk stash (#1052 / #1367).** A heartbeat timeout moves the
  **abandoned chunk** — its run/unit/chunk identity plus its fetched rows (the `metadatum` source), only that chunk,
  never the whole unit — into an `AbandonedChunk` stash held on `LibrarySyncStateBox` **outside** the run-lifecycle
  state; every chunk committed before the timeout stays committed. The stash deliberately **survives the run's
  teardown** (`finish_run` nulls `current_sync_id` but leaves the stash), because in production the frontend's late
  `report_unit_results` arrives **after** the run has already wound down — the exact window an earlier design missed,
  where the active-unit ack check could no longer match and the recovery was unreachable (#1367). The late ack matches
  the stash **by identity** (`take_abandoned_chunk`) and drives `commit_unit_results` itself over the stashed rows,
  binding the delivered shortcuts instead of leaving orphans; it **never** passes a `platform_stamp`, since a timed-out
  platform is incomplete and must not be stamped complete. The stash has a **bounded lifetime**: it is cleared at the
  next run's `try_begin_run`, so a frontend that crashes and never acks just leaves inert data that the next sync drops
  (the orphan self-heals via the existing-shortcut scan either way).
- **Cancel is chunk-atomic.** A user cancel or a timeout mid-unit forfeits only the in-flight chunk; every chunk
  committed before it survives. The `SyncRun` still completes **only at run end**, so a partial unit is never recorded
  as complete and the incremental-skip gate re-fetches it on the next run; the stale-removal scan is already skipped on
  a cancelled run, so partial progress never triggers removals.

## Consequences

- **A large unit survives a mid-apply crash.** The #797 scenario now loses one ~2-minute chunk, not 24 minutes; the
  committed chunks are on disk and the next sync resumes from the first uncommitted game.
- **The bridge payload and frontend memory are bounded by the chunk, not the unit** — ~200 KB and one chunk's closure
  instead of ~3 MB and the whole list.
- **Cancel/timeout becomes chunk-atomic rather than unit-atomic.** Cancelling a large unit keeps the games already
  committed in prior chunks — a behavior change: previously the whole in-flight unit was discarded. This is strictly
  less lost work and matches "cancel keeps finished games," but it does mean a cancelled unit can leave a **partially**
  applied platform; the next sync completes it. Platform units that _did_ finish (their last chunk committed) before the
  cancel are additionally stamped complete (`PlatformSyncState`, #1025) in the same write UoW as that final chunk, so
  the next run's incremental-skip gate skips them wholesale rather than re-walking every already-applied game through
  CEF — even though the cancelled run never completed its `SyncRun` and so never advanced the library-wide `last_sync`.
- **The stamp is the sole skip authority; its contract is
  `stamp exists ⟺ the platform's most recent apply attempt ran
  to completion`.** A completed run's library-wide
  `last_sync` is deliberately **not** a fallback for the skip: a run-scoped timestamp cannot see a platform whose
  shortcuts were locally removed and only partially re-applied since, so trusting it can silently skip a platform with
  missing shortcuts — the same gap in a second coat. No stamp means a full fetch; installations from before this
  contract carry no stamps, so their first sync re-walks once (update-path cheap) and stamps everything it completes. A
  **preview-gated** sync would otherwise strand a complete-but-unstamped platform (a late-ack recovery leaves one,
  #1416): its shortcut delta is empty, so the preview short-circuits on "no changes" before the re-walk that would
  re-stamp it ever runs, and the run's `interrupted` status lingers because only an apply run records a fresh `SyncRun`.
  So `sync_preview` counts enabled platforms lacking a stamp and offers Apply on that alone (`restamp_platform_count`);
  the re-walk's empty final chunk re-writes the stamp and records a fresh `SyncRun`. The stamp is still written **only**
  by the pipeline's final chunk — the preview counts unstamped platforms, it never stamps. Two rules keep the contract
  true. (1) The stamp is **cleared at a platform unit's apply start** (in `_sync_one_unit`, once the fetch has succeeded
  and the apply is about to emit its first chunk) and re-written only by that unit's final chunk, so an apply
  interrupted by a crash / cancel / heartbeat-timeout before the final chunk leaves **no** stamp — never a stale one
  from a prior run. (2) The **local destructive flows** invalidate the stamp of every platform whose shortcuts they
  unbind: the DangerZone remove-all and per-platform removals (both via `report_removal_results`) and the
  Steam-UI-deletion reconcile (`reconcile_live_shortcuts`) delete the touched platforms' stamps in the same write UoW as
  the unbind. Both rules exist because unbinding keeps the `roms` row (ADR-0007), so a platform's persisted-row count is
  unchanged and a surviving stamp with a matching `rom_count` would let the skip gate skip a half-mirrored platform and
  silently drop the un-recreated games (the #1025 gap). The server-side stale removal in the reporter is the deliberate
  exception — it does **not** invalidate the stamp, because a ROM the server dropped lowers RomM's platform `rom_count`,
  which the stamp's `rom_count` guard already catches on the next skip.

  > **Amendment (2026-09-28, #2084).** The `rom_count` guard catches a server drop only when the drop comes after the

  > "Incremental skip".

- **The row-count condition counts by fetch generation, not by every persisted row (#1504).** The skip requires RomM's
  platform `rom_count` to equal the local row count, and that count originally included every `roms` row for the
  platform. Rows outlive the server ids they came from: when RomM re-creates a ROM under a new id (re-import, file move,
  library rebuild) the sibling-group rebind lane moves the shortcut onto the new row and unbinds the old one, which is
  then retained forever as an identity anchor (ADR-0007). Such a superseded row inflated the count permanently, so the
  platform could never satisfy the condition again and full-fetched on **every** sync — silently, for exactly the
  long-lived libraries the skip is worth the most to. The apply therefore marks each row it commits with the **fetch
  generation** that returned it (`roms.last_fetch_id`), the completion stamp records that same generation
  (`platform_sync_state.fetch_id`), and the condition counts only rows whose generation matches the stamp's. A
  superseded row keeps an older generation, so it stops counting while staying on disk — ADR-0007's retention is
  untouched and nothing is deleted, which is the point: that ADR's rejected "auto-delete on sync-stale" alternative is
  why the fix is a marker rather than a prune. Three consequences of the chunked apply shape above: (1) the generation
  is an **opaque id (the run id)**, not a timestamp compared against `completed_at` — each chunk commits with its own
  clock reading while the stamp is built at the final chunk, so on any platform whose delta exceeds one chunk the
  earlier chunks' rows would fall before `completed_at` and the skip would count only the last chunk, wedging itself off
  permanently; (2) it is written on **every** chunk of a platform unit, not only the stamped final one, so the whole
  unit's rows share the generation its stamp names; (3) a **collection** unit writes none — a collection spans
  platforms, and re-marking a foreign platform's row would drop it from that platform's counted rows and suppress that
  platform's skip. A skipped unit returns before any chunk, so neither side is rewritten and the reference point holds
  across consecutive skips. A pre-#1504 stamp carries no generation and cannot say what its fetch returned, so the skip
  falls back to counting every row: a platform with no superseded rows keeps skipping through the upgrade, and one that
  carries them already fails the count today, so it full-fetches until both sides are re-stamped. That re-stamp lands on
  the next sync that **applies** something, not simply the next sync — both columns are written by the apply's commit,
  and a run whose library-wide delta is empty stops at the preview and reaches no commit. The wait is nonetheless short:
  an applying run commits every unit that did not wholesale-skip, including a unit whose own delta is empty (it chunks
  into a single leftover chunk), and a platform carrying superseded rows can never wholesale-skip, so it is always among
  the units such a run heals.
- **Collection units get the same fetch-avoiding skip (#742).** A user/smart collection work unit's final chunk stamps a
  `CollectionSyncState` — the collection sibling of `PlatformSyncState` — in the same write UoW as that chunk's `roms`
  upserts, so "this collection fully synced" ⟺ "stamp exists" is atomic on a crash, just like a platform. The gate skips
  a collection only when three verified RomM signals all agree with the stamp: the collection's server `updated_at` is
  unchanged (RomM bumps it on any membership add/remove, and on a smart-criteria edit — the membership-stable signal); a
  scoped `updated_after` probe keyed off the stamp's own `completed_at` reports zero rows (catching a member ROM's
  content change, and a ROM entering a smart collection via its own metadata change); and the `rom_count` still matches
  both the live listing and the stored member set. Because a collection has no local membership column to reconstruct
  from (`roms.platform_slug` is per-platform), the stamp additionally stores `member_rom_ids`, which a skipped run
  replays into the run's `synced_rom_ids` and Steam-collection membership map. The stamp is cleared on the same events
  as a platform stamp: the local destructive flows (`report_removal_results` / `reconcile_live_shortcuts`) drop any
  collection stamp whose member set intersects a removed ROM (surgical, since a collection id can't be mapped from a
  platform slug), and "Force Full Sync" clears every collection stamp wholesale alongside the platform stamps.
  Franchise/virtual collections have no stable `updated_at` and are never stamped — they always full-fetch. **Known
  limitation (rommapp/romm#3836):** until that upstream fix lands, every RomM filesystem scan re-stamps all member ROMs'
  `updated_at`, so the scoped probe fires and the skip yields a full fetch after each nightly scan — the same limitation
  the platform skip has; the design is correct regardless and becomes fully effective once the fix ships.
- **More round-trips.** A 3084 unit now runs ~16 emit/ack/commit cycles instead of one. Each cycle adds an event, a
  callable ack, and a short write UoW; the added overhead is roughly 2% of the unit's apply time — negligible against
  the crash-recovery it buys.
- **No wire-surface growth.** Extending the existing event and callable keeps the callable-manifest and event-parity
  gates green with no new names to police.
- **The operational envelope this buys against.** The crash-resume emphasis rests on a measured finding, not a
  hypothetical. Steam's renderer (`steamwebhelper` / CEF) accumulates memory as each shortcut is touched — roughly
  0.8–1.5 MB per created shortcut observed on-device — against a finite per-session budget, with the process image seen
  climbing to roughly 2.5 GB during a large first import before it OOM-crashed (#797). A mass first import of a
  multi-thousand-game library can therefore exhaust the budget **mid-run**. Chunking does not raise that ceiling; it
  converts hitting it from catastrophic loss (the whole unit forfeit) into a cheap resume — every chunk committed before
  the crash is on disk, and the next sync continues from the first uncommitted game. Raising the ceiling itself is the
  out-of-CEF bulk-import path below, out of scope for this decision.

## Alternatives considered

- **A dedicated `sync_apply_chunk` event and a new chunk-ack callable.** Rejected as pure churn: the chunk is the unit
  at a finer grain, so a parallel event/callable pair would duplicate the identity check, the late-ack path, and the
  parity-gate entries for no behavioral gain — two protocols to keep in sync instead of one.
- **A configurable chunk size** (a setting or a heuristic). Rejected: 200 already balances payload, cadence, and blast
  radius across the library sizes we see, and a user-facing knob invites misconfiguration — a too-large value re-opens
  the #797 loss — for a value no one needs to tune. `_APPLY_CHUNK_SIZE` stays a build-time constant.
- **Bulk-importing shortcuts outside CEF** (writing `shortcuts.vdf` directly, or an out-of-process importer that
  bypasses the per-shortcut SteamClient cadence). Deliberately **not** part of this decision. `shortcuts.vdf` is
  memory-authoritative — Steam rewrites it from memory and clobbers external writes while it is running (see
  [Steam Non-Steam Shortcuts](../architecture/steam-non-steam-shortcuts.md)) — so a safe bulk path requires Steam
  restarted or not running, which is a different, research-gated design. Chunking hardens the in-CEF path we have
  without blocking that future work; the bulk-import route is tracked separately.
