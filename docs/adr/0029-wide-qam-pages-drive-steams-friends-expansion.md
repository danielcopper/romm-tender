# A QAM page widens the panel by driving Steam's Friends-tab expansion, and the width belongs to the page

## Status

Accepted. Records the width decision behind [#1809](https://github.com/danielcopper/romm-tender/issues/1809) (the
panel's target structure), the first step of [#1808](https://github.com/danielcopper/romm-tender/issues/1808) (the QAM
restructure). The structure itself lives in [qam-panel.md](../architecture/qam-panel.md).

## Context

Steam renders the Quick Access Menu 348 px wide, and every tab's content panel is capped at 300 px. The plugin's panel
was built inside that number: six pages behind a router, each a full-screen replacement with a Back row, because a
narrow column cannot show a list and its detail at once; sections without titles; rows that fold two facts into a label
and a description because a third column has nowhere to go.

Steam's own Friends tab runs at 854 px. The QAM lives in a sliding container in the main window — an absolutely
positioned element the width of the viewport, anchored right and pushed off-screen by `transform: translateX(506px)`, so
348 px stay visible; Steam's `Expanded` class sets `translateX(0)`. Its class names are hashed, so it is identified by
geometry rather than by a selector. That class follows one MobX observable, `qamFriendsExpanded`, on the FriendsUI
store, which registers a `message` listener on the SharedJSContext window — the window plugin code runs in — and flips
on `QamFriendsExpanded` / `QamFriendsHidden`. The per-tab 300 px cap is a second, independent rule; only
`.TabGroupPanel.tab_Friends` lifts it.

Measured on the device (Big Picture, CEF Chrome 126), not read from documentation: posting the message widens the
visible panel from 348 px to 854 px; lifting the cap widens the plugin's tab panel from 300 px to 806 px (854 minus the
48 px tab rail). Steam ships no API for either, and Decky Loader has no notion of a wide plugin tab. Both levers are
Steam internals with no compatibility promise.

Three alternatives were weighed:

- **Stay at 348 px** and keep compressing. No open issue exists _because_ of the cap; its cost shows up as compromises
  inside otherwise-real issues (#164's missing per-file action, the totals line #886 offers as its direction (b) — a
  line, because the preview renders as one — and #1803's third column with no slot). The drill-down router is the
  largest such compromise and appears in no issue at all.
- **A full-screen Steam route** via `routerHook.addRoute`. It leaves the QAM entirely: the whole screen, no overlay over
  a running game, its own navigation model. The project's stated direction (#269) is surfaces that feel native, and a
  custom route is the opposite of that; a wide QAM tab is what Steam itself does for Friends.
- **Width per view inside a page** — a page that widens only when a detail is open. Both rules were walked on the device
  and are indistinguishable in use; the per-view rule has two places to set the flag and two to clear it.

## Decision

A page of the panel may be **wide**, and the width belongs to the page: a page is wide or it is not, no view inside a
page changes it. Main and Downloads stay narrow; Sync, Library, Settings and Data Management are wide.

A wide page, while mounted, holds both levers: it posts `QamFriendsExpanded` to `window` with `window.origin` as the
target origin, and it injects one stylesheet whose `:has()` rule lifts the tab panel's `max-width` for a marker class on
the plugin's own subtree. The class names come from `quickAccessMenuClasses`, a webpack probe that can be `undefined`
and is therefore read through the repo's honest-typing module (`frontend/src/utils/deckyUiInternals.ts`), with
`[id^="quickaccess_content_"]` as the fallback selector.

Whoever sets the flag clears it. The page posts `QamFriendsHidden` on unmount (navigation away, plugin closed), when the
Decky tab stops being the active QAM tab (the `ActiveTab` class on the panel's parent — a tab switch is only a class
change, no unmount), when the QAM closes (`useQuickAccessVisible`), and from the plugin's `onDismount`.

## Consequences

- **The wide state rests on undocumented Steam internals** — the message name, the sliding container, the `Expanded`
  class, the per-tab cap. A Steam update can silently stop the expansion; the plugin's own rule would still lift the
  cap, so a wide page would render 806 px of content inside a 348 px panel and clip. No fallback switch is built for
  that case: the rebuild proceeds, and a switch or a width-dependent navigation is reconsidered only if updates keep
  breaking it. The expansion is measurable in the dev loop through the sliding container's geometry (`findSP()`); the
  QAM browser view itself is 854 px wide in both states and proves nothing.
- **On the Deck a wide page covers the whole screen.** The Big Picture viewport is 854 × 534 CSS px at
  `devicePixelRatio` 1.5 (1280 × 800 physical), so 854 px is not a wider panel over a visible library — it is the
  library gone. On a desktop Big Picture window, which is wider, the same page is a panel with the library beside it, so
  every width judgement has to be made under `mise run dev:ui-scale deck` or it is made against a layout no Deck ever
  shows.
- **The flag is Steam's and global.** A page that leaks it leaves Steam's own QAM expanded until the Friends tab toggles
  it back. The four clearing paths above are the whole discipline — with two of Steam's own behaviours behind them:
  `OpenQuickAccessMenu` calls `SetQAMFriendsChatExpanded(false)` on every QAM tab change away from Friends, and the
  Friends tab re-expands itself from its list's `onFocusWithin`. So the flag is never ours alone to hold, and a Friends
  panel that widens after our page closed is Steam doing that, not a leak of ours.
- **`window.origin`, never a literal origin.** It addresses the message to the one window meant to receive it and always
  matches it. A well-formed target origin that does not match is checked at delivery and the message is discarded in
  silence, so a literal is a failure with no symptom but a panel that never widens; `"*"` is always delivered, but to
  any document in the window. The spike shipped a literal first and found it through 72 failing tests — which is the
  test environment's stricter behaviour (happy-dom throws where a browser discards), not the device's.
- **A wide page needs a definite height.** Steam's tabbed page fills its parent instead of growing, and nothing in the
  QAM chain provides a height; a `min-height` clips. The wide frame measures the remaining viewport and lets its regions
  scroll inside it.
- **L1/R1 tabs are a wide-only control.** At 300 px the bumper glyphs overlap the labels, which is why the Library
  page's tab bar is hand-rolled today. Narrow pages keep buttons.
