# Every gaming-mode launch is gated through one shared path via cancel-then-relaunch

## Scope

Part of [#1051](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/1051) — the launch-gate / save-conflict / offline
hardening, expanded from "4b modal hardening" after a RomM-communication audit. Addresses the **gaming-mode** portion of
[#1144](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/1144) (the one genuine non-Play-button launch path in
gaming mode — `steam://rungameid` deep links — now funnels through the gate); **desktop-mode** coverage remains open
there and under [#831](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/831).

> **Errata (2026-08).** "any Steam running-app source" below overstates what `utils/runningApps` consulted. Two of its
> three sources — `Router.MainRunningApp` and `Router.RunningApps` — were read as page globals that no SteamUI build
> defines, so they never reported anything and were removed in
> [#1588](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/1588). The already-running guard was decided by

## Context

A RomM ROM can be launched two ways in Steam gaming mode, and today they behave inconsistently:

1. **The plugin Play button** (`CustomPlayButton.handlePlay`) runs a rich gate **before** the launch — connectivity,
   save-slot setup, core-change, then a pre-launch save sync with a conflict modal — and only then calls `RunGame`.
   Because it runs before the launch, it can block cleanly.
2. **A launch that bypasses our button.** In gaming mode the library grid, the home "recent" carousel, and Big Picture
   tiles all **navigate to the detail page** (our button) — they do not launch directly (verified against the
   deobfuscated SteamUI: a tile's `onActivate` does `navigate(/library/app/:appid)`, never `RunGame`). The genuine
   non-Play-button launch paths are `steam://rungameid` deep links (which issue a launch with no detail-page visit) and
   the resilience case where a Steam UI update breaks our React-tree patch and the native Play button renders. The only
   thing watching **beneath every surface** is a global hook (`launchInterceptor.ts` via
   `SteamClient.Apps.RegisterForGameActionStart`).

The global watcher has a structural defect: it fires **after** Steam has already begun the launch, so it can only
`CancelGameAction`, never pause. Today it `await`s a network `evaluate_launch` and then cancels on a block verdict — but
the await **races the un-pausable launch**: on a slow server the verdict arrives too late and the launch slips through
(the block/conflict becomes a no-op).

A **conflict** is a two-sided divergence — the local save diverged from its `last_sync_hash` baseline **and** the server
save also diverged. Conflicts are **never persisted**; they are recomputed fresh from a server `list_saves` + local
state on every check, and `get_cached_game_detail` hard-codes `conflicts: []`. So a fresh conflict **cannot** be known
locally or synchronously — it needs a server round-trip.

The audit (#1051) found the consequences: a launch with local drift while the server is unreachable is **silently
allowed** with no warning (the soft-warn path is dead because `get_save_status` swallows the offline error); the Play
button's `RunGame` re-triggers the watcher into a **second, independent** `list_saves` (the double-gate); the offline
decision rides a **page-open-stale** module flag; multi-file slots under-report conflicts; the live save-status refresh
loop has no production trigger.

Research (the SteamClient API surface, the Steam-UI launch state machine, and the MoonDeck + unifideck plugins)
established the hard constraint: **no Steam hook lets a plugin pause a launch, run async work, and then proceed.**
Steam's internal pause/resume (`bWaitingForUI` + `ContinueGameAction`) is Steam-driven (EULA, cloud-conflict, shader
cache) and not plugin-injectable. Patching `RunGame` at the source is worse — the `@decky/ui` patchers call the original
synchronously and don't await, `RunGame` returns `void`, and it would miss launch paths that don't route through that
symbol. **Cancel-then-relaunch** (`CancelGameAction` → async work → `RunGame`) is the only mechanism, and it is the
established community pattern (MoonDeck and unifideck both use it; unifideck shows modals from the watcher in
production). The watcher **can** show a real modal — `showModal` is imperative, already used from non-component code.
Decky loads plugins **only in gaming mode** — in the desktop Steam client the whole plugin (these hooks, the session
manager, sync, and playtime) is absent, so desktop-mode launches are entirely ungated. That gap is tracked separately
([#1144](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/1144) /
[#831](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/831)): the only universal chokepoint there is the
`bin/rom-launcher` wrapper, which can sync headlessly but cannot show a modal.

## Decision

**One shared gate, run for every gaming-mode launch via cancel-then-relaunch (the "full funnel").**

- The launch-gate logic is extracted into a **single standalone async path** used by both surfaces. The Play button runs
  it before `RunGame`; the watcher runs it after cancelling.
- The global watcher intercepts **every** `LaunchApp` of a RomM-owned shortcut that did **not** originate from our Play
  button, **cancels it immediately** (synchronous — this wins the race; the launch is stopped before any network call),
  runs the full shared gate, and on approval **relaunches** via `RunGame(gameId, "", -1, 100)`.
- A **one-shot skip-set** (module-level `Set<appId>`, checked-and-deleted at watcher entry) exempts exactly one launch:
  the watcher's own relaunch, and the Play button's launch (which already ran the gate). This kills the double-gate.
- An **already-running guard** skips the whole funnel — on **both** launch surfaces — when the target appId is the live
  play session (`sessionManager` `activeRomId`) or any Steam running-app source (`utils/runningApps`) reports it
  running. The watcher checks it synchronously at entry (**before** the cancel); the Play button checks it at the top of
  `handlePlay` (its enabled state derives from cached install/conflict status, not running state, so it can't rely on
  the button being disabled). Running the pre-launch sync on an already-running game would upload the save
  **mid-session** — while the emulator holds the file open — and manufacture a conflict at exit (the watcher
  additionally cancels a launch Steam blocks as "already running" anyway). Both surfaces skip the sync and just bring
  the game to front instead (#1148 round 2). The Play button later became **state-aware** (#1313): when running is
  detected it renders **Resume** and brings the game to front via Steam's own gamescope resume path
  (`SteamUIStore.SetRunningApp` + `NavigateToRunningApp`, a dialog-free UI navigation that fires no `GameActionStart`),
  so on that surface the guard is now the **backstop for the render→click race** rather than the primary path — the
  button honestly reflects running state instead of relying on the guard to catch a Play press.
- Because the watcher cancels **first** and only then does async work, **there is no race** — the defect of awaiting
  against a live launch is gone by construction.

**What the gate does** (identical on both surfaces):

- **Not installed** → hard block (no "Start Anyway"); the ROM isn't on disk.
- **Migration pending** → block.
- **Reachability** is checked with a **fast fresh probe** at gate time — a single-attempt, short-timeout
  `heartbeat_once` (no retry/backoff, unlike the sync paths' retrying heartbeat), so an offline verdict returns in ~3s
  instead of up to ~90s on a remote timeout. The same fast probe drives the page's **offline badge** (it shows
  immediately on page open), replacing the page-open-stale connection flag.
- **Server reachable** → pre-launch save sync; a true conflict opens the conflict modal.
- **Server unreachable + local drift** → a **3-button modal** ("RomM unreachable — your local save has unsynced changes;
  playing may create a conflict you'll resolve later."): **Start Anyway** / **Retry connection** / **Cancel**. _Retry
  connection_ re-runs the gate with a fresh probe — if the server is back it proceeds down the online path (pre-launch
  sync → conflict modal / launch), otherwise the modal reappears. **Local drift is detected by content hash, never by
  file size or mtime.**
- **Server unreachable + no local drift** → allow silently (nothing to lose; reconciles on the next sync).

The watcher surfaces these as **real modals**, not toasts. The gate must **always fall back to launching on its own
error** — it never traps the user's game.

**Offline policy (made explicit and consistent across surfaces):** the offline model is recoverable, not lossy — a
launch into an undetected conflict is detected at the next sync, and conflict resolution quarantines the overwritten
local file to `.romm-backup`, so there is no silent data loss. "Unknown because the server is unreachable" is treated as
"can't verify" → the drift modal when there is local drift, silent allow otherwise.

**Desktop-mode launches** do not fire these hooks and are **not gated** — an accepted, documented limitation.

## Consequences

- **Consistent:** one behavior for all gaming-mode launch paths. The cold-launch-misses-a-fresh-conflict gap is closed;
  the gaming-mode portion of #1144 is addressed — deep-link launches now funnel through the gate. Desktop-mode launches
  remain ungated (Decky doesn't run there — #1144 / #831).
- **Cost — smaller than first feared (corrected after the SteamUI-code research):** in gaming mode, **normal launches go
  through our Play button**, which gates _before_ `RunGame` and skip-marks the launch, so the watcher skips it — **no
  flicker, no cancel-relaunch** on the common path. The cancel → gate → relaunch flicker only fires for the rare genuine
  bypass (`steam://rungameid` deep links, or a launch via the native button if our React-tree patch breaks). So the
  feared "instant-launch feel is gone on every launch" does **not** happen, and the **hybrid fast-path** is largely moot
  — there is no common direct-launch path to fast-path. Still worth an on-device confirm that a normal Play-button
  launch is flicker-free and that a deep link is caught.
- **One gate** to maintain instead of two divergent ones; the double-gate's redundant `list_saves` is gone.
- The skip-set adds a little state; its lifetime self-heals (check-and-delete at entry).
- **Both launch surfaces re-confirm `launch_options` just before `RunGame`**, via the shared
  `reconfirmLaunchOptions(romId, appId, context)` helper (in `utils/launchOptionsReconcile.ts`): it pulls
  `get_rom_relaunch_options(rom_id)` (bounded by a 3s race) and confirm-sets the shortcut's command, healing mid-session
  drift on the launch path between plugin loads ([ADR-0009](0009-launcher-pure-exec-wrapper-baked-launch-options.md)).
  Best-effort — a hang, a `None` item, or a failure still launches.
  - The **Play-button funnel** runs it in `dispatchLaunch` (after the verdict approves, on every launching branch)
    ([#1150](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/1150)).
  - The **watcher** runs it in its `relaunch` chokepoint (after `CancelGameAction` + the gate, in the already-detached
    async portion — so it adds only a bounded ≤3s wait to the cancel→relaunch window)
    ([#1152](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/1152)). This closes the previously-uncovered watcher
    path. It is **defense-in-depth** — in current Steam Gaming Mode a launch needs the game page + Play button, so the
    direct-Steam-launch watcher path is rarely reachable; its concrete win is **de-duplicating** #1150's inline
    re-confirm into the one shared helper.
- **On-device verification required** (cannot be unit-tested): the cancel-relaunch flicker, modal focus after cancel,
  slow-server feel, and the suspend hooks.

## Alternatives considered

- **Patch `RunGame` for a true async pre-gate.** Rejected: the patchers don't await, `RunGame` returns `void`, and you'd
  still have to suppress-and-re-issue (= cancel-relaunch) on a fragile internal symbol that misses non-`RunGame` launch
  paths. The `BIsModOrShortcut` prototype-patch was already dropped for exactly this fragility.
- **Two-tier gate** (rich Play button + thin watcher safety-net). Rejected for consistency: the thin watcher misses
  fresh conflicts on cold direct launches and maintains divergent logic.
- **Hybrid funnel** (cancel + route only when a synchronous signal flags). **Deferred, not rejected** — start with the
  full funnel, add the fast-path if on-device feel demands it.
- **Dirty-flag approximation for drift** (a tracked "played-since-last-sync" boolean). Rejected in favor of exact
  content hashing: fixed-size saves change content without changing size, the maintainer wants the exact signal, hashing
  one save is single-digit ms, and the watcher cancels-first so it can hash async without racing.

suspend-time playtime fix and the multi-file-slot conflict fix are bundled in the same work but are separate bugfixes,
not part of this ADR's decision.

## Amendment — a launch check that gets no answer ends in the fallback dialog

The rule that the gate never traps the user's game covered a step that throws, but not one that never answers: an
endpoint call has no timeout, so against a backend that is stopped, restarting or frozen the Play button's check waited
without end, and so did every step of the watcher's after its first backend contact.
[#2173](https://github.com/danielcopper/romm-tender/issues/2173) extends the rule to a wait:

- Every backend call the gate makes that is not a dialog has a limit — 5 s for the calls that stay on the device, 15 s
  for the two that reach RomM (the save-setup read and the pre-launch sync). A dialog's wait for the user's answer is
  never bounded.
- A limit that expires ends the check in the existing "Save Sync Unavailable" dialog with a neutral message, on both
  funnels. It does not fail open to a start: the limit can expire on a slow RomM while Tender is fine, and the Play
  button has cancelled nothing, so the user decides. "Launch Anyway" starts on the local save, which the next sync with
  RomM checks against the server's; "Cancel" starts nothing.
- After such a check, "Launch Anyway" starts the game without re-confirming the launch options, as the watcher's own
  first-contact fallback already did. Every other start keeps the re-confirm, including one after a sync that failed
  with an answer.
- The watcher's first backend contact is unchanged: past its 5 s it starts the game without the sync before it and says
  so.

The re-confirm's own sentence in Consequences no longer holds either: since
[#1577](https://github.com/danielcopper/romm-tender/issues/1577) a re-confirm that hangs past its 3 s **stops** the
launch instead of launching — the Play button returns to Play, and the watcher says "Launch cancelled — try again". A
`None` item or an ordinary failure still launches.
