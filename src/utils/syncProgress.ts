/**
 * Module-level sync progress store — single source of truth.
 *
 * Updated by:
 *   - sync_progress events from the backend (persistent listener in index.tsx)
 *   - syncManager.ts during the frontend applying phase
 *   - MainPage on mount via getSyncStatus() (backend-authoritative seed)
 *   - MainPage on handleSync click (optimistic running:true)
 *
 * Read by:
 *   - utils/syncRunView.ts, whose hook subscribes via onSyncProgressChange and
 *     re-renders its page on every notify (no setInterval polling)
 *   - utils/runUnitsStore.ts, whose mirror advances the run's per-unit rows
 *   - MainPage.tsx, which reads ``runId`` to scope a Cancel click to the active
 *     run (#1202).
 *
 * The ``runId`` field is fed straight from the backend ``sync_progress`` payload
 * (the persistent listener in index.tsx passes the whole event through), so it
 * is the single source of run identity frontend-side.

 * each phase owns a fixed fraction of the unit's slice, so the bar advances
 * continuously through the whole unit instead of resting frozen until
 * ``applying``. The three sum to 1; apply dominates because it is the phase the

/**
 * The within-unit fill fraction (0..1) for the running unit, placed in the
 * phase's own sub-slice so the coarse bar never jumps backwards at a
 * fetch→covers→apply boundary (#1407). Each phase's slice fills by that phase's
 * own ``current/total``; a later phase's slice floor sits at the sum of the
 * earlier phases' shares, so transitions only ever move the bar forward — the
 * fetch and cover frames each restart ``current/total`` from zero, but land in a
 * strictly-higher band than the phase before.
 *
 * Phase resolution:
 *   - ``applying`` → the whole fetch+covers width is done; fill the apply slice
 *     (keyed on the stage alone, so a merged frontend apply frame that still
 *     carries a stale ``subStage`` is unaffected).
 *   - ``fetching`` + ``subStage: "covers"`` → fetch slice done, fill covers.
 *   - ``fetching`` + ``subStage: "fetch"`` → fill the fetch slice.
 *   - ``fetching`` with no sub-stage (the unit's coarse anchor, or an old
 *     backend) → 0: rest at the unit floor, the pre-#1407 behaviour.
 *   - any other stage (discovering, finalizing, …) → 0.
 *
 * A falsy ``current``/``total`` yields the phase's floor (its share sum so far),
 * e.g. a covers frame with ``total: 0`` reads ``FETCH_SHARE`` — never a divide.
