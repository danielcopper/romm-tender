 *
 * Steam's gamepad navigation keeps a focus pointer across a page swap and
 * resolves it on the next input — onto whatever sits at the old page's
 * position — so a newly mounted page has to claim focus itself. Two callers do,
 * on the same delay and by the same rule: the wide-page frame for its own body
 * (`src/components/qam/WidePage.tsx`), and the panel's router for the narrow
 * pages that place none of their own (`src/index.tsx`).
 */

/**
 * Every shape Steam gives a focus stop, measured in the running QAM rather than
 * assumed: its own components render `div[tabindex="0"]` (`Focusable`, a toggle
 * row, a table row carrying an activate handler) and a `DialogButton` is a
 * native `button` with no tabindex attribute at all.
 *
 * The two selectors below are joined from this one list rather than written out
 * twice, so a shape added here reaches both.

 * the injected sheet gives them Steam's focus outline, so the stick lands on
 * them and the row stays walkable — which is why `ScrollRegion` reads this one,
 * and the entry-focus finder below takes its candidates from the narrower one
 * while testing containment against this.

/**
 * The stop a page opens on: the first enabled thing in document order that can
 * take focus and contains no focus stop of its own.
 *
 * One rule for both widths. Document order, never "the first button", because a
 * page's first button is not its first row, and it is not that on either width.
 * On a wide list-and-detail page whose list rows carry no control of their own,
 * the first button in the body is in the DETAIL pane, so a button-first rule
 * opens the page somewhere inside the detail and moves as the detail's content
 * changes. On a narrow page the same rule fails from the other end: Main's
 * status rows state rather than act, so its first button is the menu at the very
 * bottom of the panel and a button-first rule opens the page with the status it
 * leads with already scrolled off the top.
 *
 * Innermost, because a container `Focusable` carries `tabindex="0"` of its own
 * and precedes in document order every row it wraps: taking the first match
 * lands focus on the container and leaves the reader a step away from the row.
 *
 * **The two halves read different selectors on purpose.** A candidate must be
 * enabled, but a container is skipped for holding a stop of ANY kind: a button
 * row whose every button is disabled is still a container Steam's navigation
 * does not stop on, so focusing it would put the reader nowhere and take the
 * ring off the next real row. The test cannot tell that row from one carrying an
 * activate handler, so it skips both; a row whose only inner stop is disabled is
 * stepped over, which no body's first column produces today. Where that leaves
 * no candidate — no enabled stop that is free of stops inside it — nothing is
 * placed and the page keeps whatever Steam's retained pointer resolves to.
