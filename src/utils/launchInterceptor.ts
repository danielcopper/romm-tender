/**
 * Global launch watcher (ADR-0015 — the "full funnel").
 *
 * Every gaming-mode launch of a RomM-owned shortcut that did NOT originate from
 * our Play button is intercepted here. Because no Steam hook can pause a launch,
 * run async work, and then proceed, the watcher uses the cancel-then-relaunch
 * mechanism: it `CancelGameAction`s the launch IMMEDIATELY (synchronously, which
 * wins the race against the un-pausable launch), runs the shared
 * {@link runLaunchGate} funnel, and on approval relaunches via `RunGame`.
 *
 * The one-shot skip-set (`markLaunchSkipped` / `consumeLaunchSkip`, owned by
 * `launchGate.ts`) exempts exactly one launch: the watcher's own relaunch and
 * the Play button's gated launch — so neither gets re-gated (no double-gate).
 *
 * Registered on plugin load, unregistered on unload.
