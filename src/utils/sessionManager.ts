 *   would open a marker on a different row and leave the original dangling (the
 *   rule #1621 established for the stop path — an `appId → romId` binding is 1:1
 *   at any instant but not stable over time).
 * - running, ours, but unattested → re-stamped: adopted with the marker moved to
 *   `nowMs`, a truthful lower bound, and attested afterwards so a later reload
 *   adopts it as attested rather than re-stamping again.
 * - attested but NOT running → orphaned. Its stop was never observed, and a
 *   truthful finalize is impossible without an observed end, so the attestation
 *   is dropped rather than an end time fabricated.
 * - running but not ours (`resolveRomId` returns `null`) → ignored entirely. A
 *   foreign app is never adopted and never causes anything else to be orphaned.
 *
 * `tracked` names the apps that already hold an open session; both passes skip
 * them, so adoption can never re-open one a start notification opened first
 * (#1589).
 *
 * That skip is UNREACHABLE as the manager is currently wired, and deliberately
 * kept: adoption and every notification handler run on the one serialized
 * `lifecycleChain`, adoption is enqueued in the same synchronous block that
 * registers the hook, and a teardown clears the session map — so a fresh init
 * always reconciles against an empty `tracked`. Two wiring changes would make it
 * live: taking adoption off that chain (giving a notification a window to
 * complete during the up-to-15s poll), or a handler that acts directly instead
 * of enqueueing. Do not delete it as dead code without making one of those
