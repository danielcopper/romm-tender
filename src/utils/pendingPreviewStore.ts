/**
 * Module-level owner of the pending sync preview — the delta the backend has
 * computed and is holding, between the preview run that produced it and the
 * answer the user gives it (Apply, Dismiss, or a fresh Sync press).
 *
 * **Why this fact is not component state, when panel rendering state normally
 * is.** The preview outlives the panel instance that asked for it. `sync_preview`
 * is an awaited callable, so its answer is delivered to the closure of whichever
 * page pressed the button — and navigating away unmounts that instance while the
 * run keeps going. A `setPreview` in that closure then lands on a dead
 * component, and the instance actually on screen shows the idle start button
 * over a preview the backend is holding, inviting a second run on top of the
 * first. Storing the answer where the backend's own lifetime can reach it — a
 * module store, outliving every mount — is what makes the answer survive.
 *
 * **This is not a second source of truth.** The backend owns the preview; this
 * store holds its answer verbatim and is only ever filled from it. Nothing here
 * derives, re-assembles, merges or repairs a preview, and no value that
 * `sync_preview` or `get_pending_preview` did not hand over can enter. What was
 * wrong was never that the panel rendered from state — it is that the *rendering*
 * state was frozen inside one component instance while the fact it renders is
 * owned by a process that outlives it.
 *
 * **Ordering.** Two kinds of writer meet here. A READ of the backend's staged
 * snapshot ({@link refreshPendingPreview}) answers a round trip after it was
 * issued, so it describes the world as it was at issue time. An ANSWER the user
 * just produced ({@link adoptPreview}, {@link clearPendingPreview}) is true the
 * moment it is written. Every write takes a ticket when its information was
 * ISSUED and applies only if no later-issued write has already applied. So a
 * dismiss beats a read already open — that read describes a world in which the
 * user had not answered yet — and the read can never put the card back behind
 * them. Between two reads the same rule holds: the one asked for last wins,
 * whichever answers first.
 *
 * The answer verbs are not absolute, and must not be: a read ISSUED AFTER a
 * discard legitimately outranks it, because by then the backend has been told
 * and is answering about what it holds now — a fresh preview computed since, or
 * nothing. So what protects a dismissal is not the verb being privileged, it is
 * the ordering: no read that was already open when the user answered can apply.
 * A verb that stopped taking a ticket would lose to every read in flight.
 *
 * **A read only ever FILLS, never clears.** `get_pending_preview` answers
 * `preview: null` for three different situations — nothing is staged, the
 * snapshot aged out, and it is being withheld because a run is in flight — and
 * the wire cannot tell them apart. A null answer is therefore not evidence that
 * a preview this store holds is gone. Dropping one is the job of the explicit
 * answer verbs alone; expiry is carried on screen by the card's own countdown.
