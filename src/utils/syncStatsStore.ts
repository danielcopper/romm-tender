/**
 * Module-level owner of the two panel-wide sync facts: the library/run stats
 * (`get_sync_stats`) and the live session-budget reading
 * (`get_session_budget_status`).
 *
 * Both were read straight from `api/backend` by `components/MainPage.tsx`, from
 * four call sites for the stats and three for the budget, each with its own
 * `.then(setState)` and none aware of the others. Two consequences, and the
 * first was a defect: an older answer could land after a newer one and overwrite
 * it — press Force Full Sync while the paused poll has a read open and the
 * pre-clear counts win, reverting the Last-sync line and the paused derivation.
 * And because the panel owned the state, leaving the page for any submenu threw
 * it away, so coming back re-issued every read and displayed nothing until they
 * landed.
 *
 * Owning both facts here fixes both. The store holds the data; the POLICY about
 * when to ask stays with the caller — each page keeps its own polls and decides
 * when a re-read is worth issuing.
 *
 * Two properties carry it:
 *
 * **Responses apply in issue order.** Every read takes a sequence number the
 * moment it is ISSUED, and applies its answer only if no later-issued read for
 * that fact has already applied one. Arrival order is then irrelevant: whichever
 * of the callers won the race, the answer that stands is the one asked for last.
 * A read that REJECTS applies nothing and moves nothing, so an older read still
 * open remains free to answer — a failed read is not an answer, and leaving the
 * display on the last successful one is the same thing every call site did
 * before.
 *
 * **Concurrent refreshes share one request — except a read the change itself
 * provoked.** A refresh issued while one is open joins it rather than opening a
 * second round-trip, under the admission rule stated in `api/sharedReads.ts`:
 * joinable only where the answer cannot change between the moment the first
 * caller issued the read and the moment this one joins it. Both facts here are
 * whole-plugin reads taking no argument, so the join needs no key.
 *
 * What that rule excludes is every read issued BECAUSE the fact just changed.
 * The open read such a caller would join was issued before the change, so
 * joining hands it the pre-change answer as though it were the post-change one —
 * the very overwrite the issue ordering exists to prevent, except permanent: a
 * change-driven read is typically the last one its call site will issue, so no
 * later answer follows to correct it. Those callers take the `…AfterChange`
 * twin, which issues its own read and, by being issued last, supersedes the one
 * already open for every later joiner too. The rule decides this, not a list of
 * call sites: a new caller re-reading because something changed takes the twin,
 * whatever it was that changed.
 *
 * {@link useSyncStats} is read by `components/MainPage.tsx` and by the Sync
 * page's `useSyncPage`; {@link useSessionBudget} and {@link useSyncStatsFailed}
 * only by the latter, which is where the session-budget card lives.
