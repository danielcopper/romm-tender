/**
 * Live sync-ETA estimator — the run-scoped "9 min left" countdown shown while a
 * sync is applying shortcuts. Where ``syncEstimate.ts`` is a STATIC pre-run cost
 * model (item counts → an upper-bound duration), this module measures the REAL
 * apply rate from the progress stream and projects the time left, so the readout
 * reflects the run in front of the user and counts down as it proceeds.
 *
 * The math is pure and unit-tested (``cumulativeProcessed`` / ``windowedRate`` /
 * ``remainingSeconds`` / ``formatEtaCountdown``). A thin run-scoped state layer
 * (``beginEtaRun`` / ``observeApplyProgress`` / ``liveEtaSeconds`` /
 * ``displayedEtaSeconds`` / ``resetEta``) is the seam the ``sync_plan`` listener
 * (index.tsx) and ``syncRunView.ts`` drive: the plan sets the per-unit weights +
 * total, and the hook feeds one sample per applying progress frame and exposes
 * the sticky countdown via ``displayedEtaSeconds`` — the module owns the
 * deadline, so the UI holds no ETA state of its own.
 *
 * Approximation, by design — though a narrow one since the plan went skip-aware
 * (#1382): a unit's seeded weight is 0 when the backend predicts its wholesale
 * incremental skip, else the persisted post-collapse (sibling-group) shortcut
 * count, so seed weights and the applying stage's post-collapse ``current``
 * usually count the same thing. The raw pre-collapse ``rom_count`` remains the
 * fallback only where the backend doesn't know better (never-synced platforms,
 * collections, old backends), and a mis-predicted skip re-corrects the moment
 * the unit dispatches (``observeUnitTotal``). Residual skew is absorbed by the
 * measured rate. It is an estimate, never a guarantee — a mis-prediction can
 * only make the readout long or short, never change what the sync applies.
