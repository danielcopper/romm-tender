/**
 * BiosTab — the BIOS & Emulator pane of the RomM game detail panel.
 *
 * Render only. Everything it shows arrives as props, because the requirement
 * (`biosStatus`) and the core it is shown against (`coreInfo`) have to reach a
 * render TOGETHER. On a core change the panel reads both in one `Promise.all`
 * and folds them into one update; split across two owners the change would land
 * as two renders, and in between the pane highlights the previous core's line
 * and names it in the "Active Core" row against a requirement set that has
 * already moved. The per-file LABELS are not part of that window —
 * `coreInfo.emulators` is the platform's core list, which a core switch does not
 * change.
 *
 * Two axes are rendered side by side and must not be conflated. A file's
 * `wanted` is what the whole machine says about it; `required_by_active` is what
 * the core this game launches with says. The readiness line is about the second
 * — a file another core demands is not a missing prerequisite for this launch —
 * while the rows below it show the first, so nothing is silently dropped from
 * the list for belonging to a core the user is not using.
 *
 * A row can also be a file an emulator wants that the RomM library does not hold
 * (`on_server` false). No page in the plugin can fetch it, so it says so rather
 * than looking like a download nobody has started. Not holding it is a separate
 * question from not having it: RetroDECK ships `dolphin-emu/Sys/codehandler.bin`
 * into the BIOS directory, so that row is unfetchable and satisfied at once —
 * and where the reading establishes whose copy is there, it reads as the
 * distribution's own file rather than as a gap in a library that will never
 * hold it (`utils/biosFileNote`).
 *
 * CSS classes prefixed with `romm-panel-` are injected separately by
 * styleInjector.

 *

 * reads, so "0/20 files ready" beside it claimed a readiness it did not mean
 * (#1660). What is true there is that nothing is required; the ratio is then
 * inventory, and says so. "Optional" would be the wrong word for it — those
 * files may be required by a core the user is not launching with.
 *
 * The **console's own demand** (`system_image`) is a third shape and comes first
 * among the answers, because it is the one no count can state: the console needs
 * ONE of these images and the core's declaration can only mark each of them
 * optional. So it says "one of these" and never a required-file ratio — a
 * PlayStation page read a green "Nothing required (0/20 files held)" while no
 * game on it would start. It names no core: which core the sentence is about is
 * the highlighted line in the list below, and repeating it here would be the
