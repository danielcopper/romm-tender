 *  so the `[appId]` effect never re-runs and its `cancelled` flag never fires
 *  for it (#1713).
 *
 *  Whether a binding ALSO drops the update once the panel that issued the read
 *  is gone is the constructor's to decide, and the two ends do not cover each
 *  other. A read that outlives its effect run needs both, so hand it a
 *  {@link bindRom} binding — a {@link bindRomInState} one carries the rom end
 *  alone and would let that run's answer land.
 *
