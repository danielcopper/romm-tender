/**
 * The shared shell for the plugin's inline-validating prompt modals (ConnectModal,
 * SgdbApiKeyModal): a bare {@link ModalRoot} carrying a title, the caller's field
 * content, an inline error line above the footer, and a footer with a primary
 * submit button plus a Cancel button. Owns only the shell chrome and its style
 * constants — the field content, gating, and submit/validation logic stay with
 * each modal, passed in as `children` and the labelled props. A modal that shows
 * fields, gates a primary action, and surfaces a returned error inline belongs
 * here rather than re-copying the scaffolding.
