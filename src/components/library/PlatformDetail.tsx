 * established for the platform at all.
 *
 * That last one states no count. The rows nothing could answer for are counted
 * once, under the table where the line that carries them also says where to
 * report the gap — and on this platform they are every row, so a count up here
 * as well is the same sentence twice on one screen.
 *
 * **The first two can hold together, and the withheld row is then the truer
 * sentence.** They co-occur on a console that needs an image whose required
 * folder row the read could not judge — the LRPS2 shape. They are not two gaps
 * over two different file sets there: a row that is `required_by_active` always
 * carries the active core, so it is always one of the rows the console's
 * disjunction is read over (`classify_system_image`). It need not be WHY that
 * verdict declined — an image the rows show held while the resolver says the core
 * will not start declines it too, with no withheld row anywhere near it — but it
 * is always inside the set the console's sentence is about, and it is the only
 * half of the pair that can name a file. Saying both would point twice at one
 * file list, once named and once vague; saying only the console's would drop the
 * pointer into that list, where the row shows the caveat explaining itself. So
 * the withheld count is checked first. The reverse — a console demand unsettled
 * with no withheld required row — is a different platform and keeps its own

/**
 * The first mark in one row's `On disk` cell, as a glyph and a colour.
 *
 * Two facts, two channels, so neither has to be read off the other:
 *
 * - **the glyph is the VERDICT** — `✓` met, `✗` not met, `?` nothing could
 *   establish it. It is `BiosFileEntry.satisfied`, **never presence**: for a
 *   declared folder the two come apart completely, since RetroDECK links
 *   LRPS2's `pcsx2/bios` onto the BIOS root, so the folder is always there and
 *   what satisfies the core is a file inside it.
 * - **the colour is the NEED** — strong where the core the platform launches
 *   with requires the file, muted where it does not, **amber where nothing
 *   could say**. Keyed on `required_by_active`, not `wanted`, because the
 *   summary above the table counts the same way and the two must not disagree
 *   about what "required" means.
 *
 * The two axes are read in that order, and the order is load-bearing. A row with
 * no placement is `wanted: "unknown"` — no installed emulator could be asked —
 * and its verdict is `downloaded` all the same (`domain/bios_status.py`,
 * `_row_verdict(None, …)`), so it IS established. Testing the need axis first
 * would spend the glyph on a need-axis fact and throw that verdict away, and a
 * platform nothing could be asked about is made entirely of such rows: that is
 * the pane telling the reader they can place BIOS files by hand, so which ones
 * are already there is the one thing it must not stop saying.
 *
 * So the four states the device pass asked for come out as required + met green
 * `✓`, required + unmet red `✗`, spare + met pale green `✓`, spare + unmet grey
 * `✗`; a need nothing could establish keeps its glyph and goes amber; and only a
 * verdict nothing could establish becomes `?`.
 *
 * `not_needed` and `optional` share the muted branch on purpose: for the core
 * about to launch, a file it does not require is not a gap either way.
 *
 * The `Contents` cell reads the same `satisfied`, so the two columns are two
 * renderings of one field and cannot contradict each other.

 * What arrives is the core's own `firmwareN_desc` out of its `.info` file, or,
 * for a row no placement covers, the file name itself (`build_file_entry`'s
 * `else file_name`). Both spell the name into the words.
 *
 * Measured over the 292 `.info` files a stock RetroDECK ships — 695 declared
 * firmware entries — the description's relation to the row's own `file_name`
 * (which is `os.path.basename` of the declared path) falls into six shapes:
 *
 * | 245 | 35% | it IS the name — `"macventure.dat"`                          |
 * | 328 | 47% | the name, a space, then prose — `"scph5500.bin (PS1 JP BIOS)"` |
 * | 115 | 17% | the same, but the name carries its directory — `"dc/dc_boot.bin (Dreamcast BIOS)"` |
 * |   5 |  1% | the first token names something else — a folder the file sits in (`"'Databases' folder"`), or a misspelling of it (two upstream typos) |
 * |   1 |  0% | it names the file, but the name has a space in it — `"7800 BIOS (U).rom (7800 BIOS)"` |
 * |   1 |  0% | it names the file in quotes — `"'pcsx2/bios' folder"`, the corpus's only folder declaration |
 *
 * So the rule has two halves: strip the name where the description opens with
 * it verbatim (which is the only way a name containing spaces can be seen), and
 * otherwise strip a first token that names this file — as itself or at the end
 * of a path, with surrounding quotes ignored.
 * Together they fire on 690 of the 695 and on the no-placement case; the
 * remaining five say something real and are printed whole. The name half is
 * anchored at the start rather than searched for anywhere, because a rule that
 * scanned the whole string would cut into prose that merely quotes the name.
 * The prose is kept verbatim, parentheses and all, because it is the packager's
 * own words and re-punctuating it is a second way to be wrong.
 *
 * The counts were taken over the deployed flatpak with
 * `grep -o … | wc -l`-style matching per entry rather than per line: the shapes
 * are counted by classifying every `firmwareN_path` / `firmwareN_desc` pair,
 * which is reproducible by re-running that classification over the same tree.
