/**
 * The Library page's Platforms tab: every platform RomM reports with at least
 * one ROM on the left, the focused one's detail on the right.
 *
 * The row is where a platform is switched on and off. That is the page's only
 * sync control: focus is already on the row and A works the toggle, so the
 * detail does not offer a second one.
 *
 * The BIOS state is a DOT and nothing else. The row carried the ratio too until
 * the device pass found it earned nothing in a line you scan past — the detail
 * pane one keypress away states it properly, with the files it is made of. So
 * the dot now carries the signal alone rather than reinforcing a number: it
 * takes the shared mapping's answer, it is drawn on every row even where there
 * is no level (one that came and went shifted every name beside it), and the
 * words behind it are the row's `title`, which is where the number went rather
 * than away.
 *
 * Structure and vocabulary: `docs/architecture/qam-panel.md`, section Library.
