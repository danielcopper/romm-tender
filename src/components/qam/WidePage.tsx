 * and the title, an optional L1/R1 tab bar, and a body of a definite, measured
 * height.
 *
 * Back on the gamepad is **B**, bound once by the panel's router for every
 * sub-page (`src/index.tsx`) rather than here — so the narrow pages get it too,
 * and Main, which has nowhere to go back to, keeps Decky's own B. What the frame
 * has to do is get out of the way: Steam's tabbed page binds the content pane's
 * `onCancelButton` to "focus the tab row" unless `cancelSkipTabHeader` is
 * passed, so the first B inside a tab would be swallowed there. The chip stays
 * as the discoverable half and as the mouse path.
 *
 * The page's own content is `children`, or — when the page has tabs — the
 * `content` of each tab, which Steam's `Tabs` renders itself. Either way the
 * frame opens the page with focus inside that body rather than on the Back row.

 * takes `height: 100%` of a parent it is already inset within, so its bottom

 *
 * The height is the whole of the scroller below the body's own top, less this
 * frame's gap. The ancestors' overhang is not taken out of it: it rides along
 * as the second half of the pair, and the caller spends it as a negative bottom
 * margin on the root. Measured live, that is the difference between a page
 * ending 62 px above the panel's box and one ending flush with the gap, with
 * the scroller unscrollable either way (`scrollHeight` 750 == `clientHeight`).
 *
 * **The quantity has to be free of the scroller's own offset, and only a
 * layout-relative one is.** Every viewport-relative form grows as the panel
 * scrolls, which makes the measurement feed itself: a body measured part-way
 * down comes out that much too tall, the panel then has that much more to
 * scroll, and nothing re-measures. It can be measured part-way down because
 * `QAMPanel` resets the panel's scroll inside a `requestAnimationFrame`, a
 * frame after this page's layout effect has already run.
 *
 * Measured live in the QAM over the mounted page, at panel offsets 0 / 200 /
 * 500 / 634 px: `innerHeight - top` answers 648 / 848 / 1148 / 1283, and so
 * does the scroller's own `bottom - top` — the panel's rect bottom is 764.3
 * against an `innerHeight` of 764, so bounding to the panel rather than the
 * window changes no number at any offset. This form answers 648 at all four.
 *
 * Both branches assume the scroller is an element other than the viewport's own.
 * The document element would break the first — it IS the viewport's scroller, so
 * its rect moves under its own scroll and the difference is already offset-free,
 * making `+ scrollTop` a double count. And the `null` branch is reached when no
 * ancestor computes `overflow-y: auto|scroll`, which is not the same as nothing
 * scrolling: a document scrolling at the viewport level is exactly that case,
 * and there the fallback is the self-amplifying form again. Neither is reachable
 * from the QAM, where the panel is an ordinary element and Steam's own document
 * does not scroll.
