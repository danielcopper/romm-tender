## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Tender, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT open a public GitHub issue.**
2. Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/danielcopper/romm-tender/security/advisories/new) to report
   privately.
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

You should receive a response within 7 days.

## Scope

This plugin handles:

- **A scoped RomM Client API Token** stored in the plugin's settings file (`settings.json`) in Decky's settings
  directory. The token is either **minted by the plugin** at credential sign-in — your RomM username and password are
  used **once, in memory only**, then discarded, never written to disk — or **supplied by you**: a Client API Token you
  created in RomM's web UI and pasted in (e.g. for OIDC / SSO accounts, which have no password to mint from). In both
  cases the plugin stores only the server URL, the token (plus its server-side id when minted; none for a user-supplied
  token), the origin it was minted or accepted against, a provenance marker, and the SSL-verification flag.
- **An optional SteamGridDB API key** stored in the same `settings.json`
- **HTTP requests** to self-hosted RomM servers (optionally with SSL verification disabled for self-signed certificates)

### Known security considerations

- The settings file is stored with `0600` permissions (owner-only read/write); the plugin actively migrates an older
  world-readable `0644` file to `0600` on load.
- Credentials and tokens are never logged — masked in all log output.
- The RomM Client API Token is **bound to the origin it was minted or accepted against** (`scheme://host[:port]`) and is
  only ever sent to that exact origin — a user-supplied token is stamped with the origin it was validated against at
  sign-in. If the configured server URL no longer matches, the bearer is withheld rather than sent — a changed or
  hostile host never receives the credential.
- The plugin **never deletes or modifies a user-supplied token** on the RomM server — that token's lifecycle is managed
  by you in RomM; only tokens the plugin itself minted are revoked on re-sign-in. **Signing out clears the token locally
  only** — it forgets the token on this device but does **not** revoke it server-side; revoke it yourself in RomM if you
  no longer want it.
- The **pairing code** used to sign in without pasting a token is a short-lived (60-second), single-use, 8-character
  code exchanged over an unauthenticated endpoint (the code is the only credential). It is never logged and is discarded
  after the exchange; the RomM server delivers the freshly rotated raw token only to this device in the exchange
  response.
- Path components supplied by the RomM server (filenames, ROM and save paths) are validated against path traversal
  before they are used to build local filesystem paths, so a compromised or malicious server cannot write outside the
  plugin's directories.
- The `allow_insecure_ssl` option disables certificate verification for self-hosted servers with self-signed
  certificates. This is an opt-in user setting with a warning in the UI.
