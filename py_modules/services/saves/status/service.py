        - Local file(s) present: run ``compute_sync_action`` per file and
          surface each file's status, server attribution, and any conflict.
          A multi-file slot (e.g. Saturn ``.bkr``/``.bcr``/``.smpc``, #908)
          yields one row per component file, so a conflict on any component
          surfaces in ``conflicts`` — matching ``do_sync_rom_saves`` and
          keeping the launch gate's view consistent with the sync view.
        - No local file but the slot has server saves: surface the newest
          server save as a single "ready to download" row. The canonical
          local target is ``<rom_name>.<server.file_extension>`` — derived
          purely from RetroArch's view of the ROM.
        - ROM not installed (no rom_name available) → no entry. There is
          no server-derived filename fallback: without a deterministic
          local path we cannot tell the user where a download would land.
        - Empty slot → no entry.

        Older versions of the same slot are reachable via the lazy-fetched
        ``Previous Versions`` dropdown (``list_file_versions``).

        The one allowed mutation is recording an adopted baseline hash when
        the action requests it (``Skip(adopt_baseline=True)``) — pure state
        hygiene, persisted via a short write UoW only when it actually fires.

        When *server_query_failed* is True the caller's ``list_saves`` call
        raised before *server_saves* was populated. Matrix evaluation runs
        as usual against the empty list (so local-file rows still appear
        with paths/sizes/hashes), but each resulting status is rewritten
        to ``"unknown"`` and server-side fields are nulled out — the empty
        list classifies every local save as Upload, which would surface a
        misleading "ready to upload" indicator on what is in fact a
        connectivity blip.

        ``server_query_reason`` carries the :func:`classify_error` slug for
