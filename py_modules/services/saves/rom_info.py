Resolves the on-disk save directory for an installed ROM (honouring
RetroArch's ``sort_savefiles_*`` settings and the optional per-core
subdirectory) and enumerates the matching local save files. Pure
filesystem + path-algebra responsibility — no RomM I/O, no state

about whether a save-sort migration is pending live here too because
they share ``_get_rom_save_info``'s decision to honour the previous
