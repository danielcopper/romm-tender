"""Shared mutable state for the library sync pipeline.

Owned by :class:`LibraryService`; each sub-service receives a reference
so they can coordinate without back-refs to the façade. The contract:
sub-services mutate the box's coordination fields directly (it is the
single source of truth for in-flight sync run state); the façade exposes
property accessors over the box so external callers see a flat shape
rather than reaching through ``service._state.x``.

The run-lifecycle pair — ``sync_state`` and ``current_sync_id`` — is the
one exception: it is mutated **only** through the box's own verb methods
(``try_begin_run`` / ``request_cancel`` / ``finish_run``), never by direct
field assignment from a sub-service. Confining those two writes to the box
keeps run admission, cancellation, and termination a single
compare-and-swap on the one event loop, so a rapid Sync/Cancel can't leave
a half-reset run id (#1202). Enforced by ``scripts/check_sync_lifecycle_owner.py``.

``pending_delta`` is held to the same discipline, unenforced: the staged
preview snapshot is written only through ``stage_preview`` /
``read_fresh_preview`` / ``discard_preview``, so its whole lifetime — when it
appears, when it ages out, when it is consumed — is readable in one place
rather than inferred from assignments scattered across the orchestrator. The
TTL lives here with it.
