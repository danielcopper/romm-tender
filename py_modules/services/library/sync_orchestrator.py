"""Preview / apply / per-unit sync lifecycle and progress emission.

Owns every async path the user triggers from the QAM that mutates in-flight
sync state: starting and cancelling syncs, computing a preview (read-only),
and dispatching the per-unit sync pipeline on apply. Of the heartbeat clock
this module holds only two of the three stamps — the one taken when a run is
admitted, and the frontend's ``sync_heartbeat`` route. The stamp that opens a
chunk's 60-second window, and the wait that measures against it, belong to
:class:`ChunkDispatcher`, so the window a timeout is judged by starts at a
chunk's emit rather than at run admission. Progress emission lives here —
sub-services that need to surface progress receive the orchestrator's
``emit_progress`` callback through their config. Anything that fetches ROMs
belongs in :class:`LibraryFetcher`; anything that finalises shortcuts after the apply
completes belongs in :class:`SyncReporter`; Steam's renderer memory belongs
in :class:`SessionBudgetMonitor`; a single ROM's launch facts — where its
file is and what runs it — belong in :class:`ShortcutLaunchResolver`; driving
one unit's built delta to the frontend and back — emit a chunk, wait for its
ack, commit it — belongs in :class:`ChunkDispatcher`; a unit's covers — the
invalidation pass, the download, and the ``cover_path`` stamped onto each
emitted entry — belong in :class:`CoverPreparer`; the run's own ``SyncRun`` row
— opened at the plan, closed once by the status that ended the run — belongs in
:class:`SyncRunRecorder`; reading
the registry and the completion stamps into the projections these decisions
are made against belongs in :class:`LocalLibraryReader`. Two of that last group
are this module's deliberately: the platform stamp's DELETE — a write, and a step
of the apply pipeline rather than a question a run weighs; its ordering is argued
at its call site — and the pure component-key stamp, which does no I/O at all.
**Which** terminal status a stopped run is recorded with belongs here: the priority
a pause, a heartbeat timeout and the user's Cancel are read in follows from what
this pipeline observed while it ran. The recorder writes that answer, never picks it. Cached
``rom_metadata`` is written by the reporter's per-unit commit (the same write
UoW as the ``roms`` upsert), so preview never persists metadata and an
interrupted apply leaves only already-committed units' metadata.

    stamp's DELETE at a unit's apply start), the launcher path every built
    shortcut's ``exe`` names, the shared
    :class:`LibrarySyncStateBox`, and the :class:`LibraryFetcher` peer the
    orchestrator delegates per-unit fetches to. The ``reporter``
    field is a :class:`LateBinding` because :class:`LibraryService`
    constructs the orchestrator before the reporter exists; the façade
    plugs the reader in via ``set()`` once the reporter is built. The
    ``shortcut_launch_resolver`` peer answers the two per-ROM questions each
    shortcut bake needs — the disc-resolved installed path and the active
    emulator — which preview and the per-unit apply both hand straight to
    :func:`build_shortcuts_data`. The ``local_library_reader`` peer answers every
    question the run asks of this device's own record of the library — the
    classify baseline, the per-unit bound-row projection, the unstamped-platform
    count, the resident sibling-group keys, and the stale-row scan — each in its
    own short read Unit of Work, where the fetcher asks the same kinds of
    question of RomM. The ``chunk_dispatcher`` peer takes the unit's built delta
    the rest of the way: it emits each chunk to the frontend, waits out the
    heartbeat clock for the ack, and commits the chunk through the reporter. The
    ``session_budget`` seam owns every
    renderer-heap reading and verdict, which the dispatcher asks at each chunk
    boundary — whether applying the chunk would exhaust Steam's per-session heap
    budget, and how much headroom is left for the chunk's additive cover work
    (#1383); the terminal memory delta this module reports is drawn from the same
    seam. The ``cover_preparer`` peer holds the apply path's covers, and the
    reporter holds the same ``artwork`` seam for commit-time cover-path
    finalisation — between them, no ``ArtworkManager`` is owed here. The
    ``sync_run_recorder`` peer writes the run's ``SyncRun`` row: this module
    decides which terminal status a stopped run earns, and hands that decision
    over as a method call.
