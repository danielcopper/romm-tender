"""Steam's per-session renderer-heap budget — measurement, pause, and reporting.

Owns every renderer-RSS **reading** the sync subsystem takes, and the verdicts
drawn from one: the GC-settled measurement itself, the chunk-boundary pause
decision, the trim of additive chunk work to whatever headroom that decision
left, the post-preview prognosis, the run-start baseline behind the last-run
delta, and the live reading the QAM banners poll. The pure arithmetic behind
every one of those decisions is :mod:`domain.session_budget`; the ``/proc``
reader and the CDP garbage-collect trigger are adapters reached through the
``RendererRssFn`` / ``RendererGcFn`` seams. What belongs here is the
orchestration between the two — measure, ask the domain, record the verdict on
the shared :class:`LibrarySyncStateBox`.

One site in :mod:`services.library.sync_orchestrator` still prices against the
budget, from a reading this module handed it rather than one it took: the
terminal ``session_memory_delta`` / ``post_run_advisory`` computation in
``_finalize_per_unit``. It sits with the finalize phase it belongs to; what
never happens outside this module is taking a reading.

Fail-open is the contract of every path: an unavailable reading, or any seam
error, degrades to "no verdict" (no pause, no warning, no number) and never
raises into the caller. Steam's memory is an advisory input to a sync, never a
reason one fails.
