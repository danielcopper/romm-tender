    a second implementation of the discipline is how the first one stops being

    ``saves_dir`` is the directory the file sits in and ``filename`` its name;
    the backup lands in ``<saves_dir>/.romm-backup/``. Returns ``True`` when a

    Adoption renames a ROM to the server's name and has to carry that ROM's saves

    is the one MigrationService recorded, honouring a pending save-sort
    migration, and **not** the live ``retroarch.cfg``. The two differ exactly
    while a migration is pending, and that is the case where a rename reading the
    live config would move the files out from under the sync.

    Distinct from :class:`RetroArchSaveLayoutProvider`, which reads the live
    config: that one answers whether saves are written next to the ROM at all
    (``savefiles_in_content_dir``), a state MigrationService records no marker
    for. A UoW-opening seam — the caller resolves it outside any open Unit of

    ``sync_all_saves`` pre-negotiate), a concrete ``rom_id`` scopes it to that
    one ROM (the single-ROM negotiate trigger). Only confirmed, non-legacy-slot
    ROMs with local save files contribute entries — the wizard gate stays
    upstream of negotiate (ADR-0016).

    ``save_answer`` hands the scoped form a save reading the caller already took
