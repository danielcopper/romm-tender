Joins the RomM listing with the machine's demand and answers in rows plus
aggregates: what each file is, whether the requirement it carries is met, and
the platform-wide verdict that follows. Both answers come off one builder, so a
platform and its games can never show a different level for the same files.

The demand is read once per query for the whole machine, so one file cannot
answer differently on two surfaces. Only the question "may an absence be read as
*nothing wants it*" is narrowed, to the libretro cores ES-DE offers for the

        not the same NUMBER, and are not meant to be: the count is drawn from
        the download records, while a row exists only where something declares
        the file or the library offers it — a download RomM has since dropped
        and no core declares raises the count with no row to show it, and only
        the platform-wide button can reach it.

        The delete is authorised by the record and unlinks the path that record
        holds, so this is exactly that set: recorded paths under one of the
        platform's firmware slugs that are still on disk, counted as distinct
        PATHS because two records naming one file are one unlink.

        **A row's count is answered two ways, because a row is one of two
        things.** A declared FILE matches a record by name — the row knows its
        file name and not our record. A declared FOLDER has no name a record
        could carry, so it counts the distinct files our records name
        *underneath* it: the emulator lists that folder and whatever we
        downloaded into it is ours to remove, which is a rule about files and is
        independent of the separate rule that a folder is never offered as a
        download. Distinct for the reason the platform count is — a row's number
        is what its button promises to unlink. The folder path is used to NARROW
        the record set and never to widen it, so a destination that has since
        moved can only offer fewer files, never something the plugin did not
        place.

        None of this is ``downloaded``, and none of it may be replaced by that:
        it is ``os.path.exists`` at the row's own destination, equally true of
        firmware the emulator shipped with. ``local_count`` is a third set again
        — the library's progress ratio, which includes files the plugin never
        placed and drops our own downloads once RomM stops listing them; used

    The scope an absence is judged against. ``None`` means the scope itself

    has two causes that are the same thing to the caller: the emulator
    catalogue could not be read (no installation detected, a refusal on the
    answer, or the resolver raised), or it was read and offers this system no
    libretro core at all.

    The second is not a corner case. 35 of ES-DE's 172 systems have no
    libretro command, ``ps3`` among them — a mapped RomM platform whose only
    entry is RPCS3. An empty list would be a *complete* reading of nothing:
    every server file classifies ``not_needed``, ``required_count`` is 0, and
    the platform reads a green "Nothing required" over firmware RPCS3 will
    not boot without. The same applies to any RomM slug ``resolve_system``
    maps to a name ``es_systems.xml`` does not carry. Grey ``unknown`` is
    the honest answer for a platform whose emulators this service does not
    enumerate, and it is what ADR-0020's standalone deferral licenses.

    Standalone entries are out of the scope by that deferral rather than by
    oversight: ADR-0020 defers standalone BIOS accuracy (inheriting
    ADR-0012's), and ``get_active_core`` is libretro-only for the same
    reason. Widening the scope is not the whole of lifting it — the resolver
    does answer per-system for standalone emulators, but
    ``_vendor/atlas/data/standalone_firmware.json`` holds cards for five of
    them (CEMU, DUCKSTATION, MELONDS, PCSX2, XEMU), and those five answer
    ``declaration="packaged"``. Every other standalone emulator answers
    ``declaration="unsupported"``, which upstream documents as meaning
    unknown, not "needs nothing" — measured here, 20 distinct standalone
    emulators in ``es_systems.xml`` and so 15 of them uncovered, though that
    count moves with each RetroDECK release. So the deferral outlives this
    scope: upstream coverage has to arrive first.

    Takes the already-read options rather than the system name so a caller
    that needs the emulator list anyway reads it once.
