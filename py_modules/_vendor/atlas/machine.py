"""The machine seam — the one injected protocol every machine access flows through.

atlas is a resolver: it answers questions about the running machine by reading
the running machine. All of that reading goes through a :class:`Machine`, which
abstracts the machine itself — files, directories, symlinks, and the answers
only a core binary can give. In production the machine is the real one
(:class:`RealMachine`); in tests and conformance vectors it is a fixture
(:class:`FixtureMachine`): files, directories, symlinks, and core answers as
plain data describing a whole machine, including broken links, unreadable
files, and unloadable cores. One code path, two data sources, so everything
atlas concludes is provable from data — the failure states included.

Every operation reports an explicit outcome instead of collapsing failure
modes: ``read_text`` distinguishes *missing* from *unreadable* from
*invalid text*, and ``path_kind`` distinguishes a file from a directory from
an inaccessible path. The resolver needs those distinctions because the
emulators make them — RetroArch applies a configured directory only when
``path_is_directory()`` succeeds — and because health reporting must never
present a present-but-broken installation as absent or healthy.

``readlink`` exists because RetroDECK's standalone save architecture is symlinks
(``dir_prep``): the emulator-side path and the real path are two truthful
answers to different questions, and a dead link is a real state the resolver
must be able to see. ``query_core`` exists because ``library_name`` — the value
that names sort-by-core directories and the override directory — lives only in
the core binary; loading the core and asking it is the same read RetroArch
performs. A live read, never a shipped table.

``file_size`` and ``file_digest`` exist because firmware identity is checked by
content, not by name: a file present under the right name may still be the
wrong dump. ``file_size`` is the free pre-filter (one ``stat``) that settles
most mismatches before any bytes are hashed; ``file_digest`` is the paid
answer. Both return ``None`` for *cannot tell* — never a sentinel that a caller
could mistake for a real value.

Path resolution (normative, for ports): a path is walked component by component
from ``/``, the way ``path_resolution(7)`` describes and the kernel was observed
to behave. ``.`` and repeated separators are transparent; ``..`` is applied to
where the walk *landed*, so ``link/..`` leaves the link's target directory, not
the directory the link sits in; a symlink component is replaced by its target
and the walk continues. Every component the walk steps *through* must be a
directory, which is what makes the failure spellings answer as they do: a
trailing ``/`` on a regular file is ``ENOTDIR``, reported as *missing*, while
the same spelling on a directory is transparent. Lexical normalization
(``os.path.normpath``) is not this: it eats the component in front of a ``..``
even when that component is a symlink, and the kernel does the opposite.

Glob semantics (normative, for ports): patterns support ``*``, ``?`` and
``[seq]`` within one path segment; a wildcard never crosses a ``/``; a wildcard
segment never matches a name starting with ``.`` (only a segment that itself
starts with ``.`` does); a wildcard segment that is not the last one matches
directories only, following symlinks to decide; a pattern ending in ``/``
matches directories only and keeps that ``/``; a relative pattern matches
nothing, because the working directory is not a fact about the machine; matches
are returned sorted, spelled the way the pattern reached them (a file matched
through a symlinked directory keeps the link-side path).

``glob`` reports **how much of the walk it could read**, because "the directory
is empty" and "the directory could not be listed" are the same empty list
otherwise — and the second is the shape of a save directory on a card that
dropped off the bus. A pattern can need several directories, so the answer is
per-directory rather than all-or-nothing: ``matches`` carries what *was* found
and ``unreadable`` names every place the walk could not look. Not every empty
answer is a failure: a name that is not there, or a path component that is not
a directory, is a truthful negative and keeps the answer ``complete`` — only a
read that *failed* (permissions, a symlink loop, I/O) makes it ``incomplete``.
This is the one operation whose payload is partial rather than absent, and it
is why the two are separate fields instead of a status alone.

    """A machine backed by plain data: files, directories, symlinks, core answers.

    ``files`` maps absolute paths to contents — a string is readable content;
    ``{"status": "unreadable"}`` / ``{"status": "invalid-text"}`` is a file
    that exists but yields that read outcome; ``{"md5": ..., "sha1": ...,
    "size": ...}`` is a binary blob that exists, reads as ``invalid-text``, and
    answers those values for ``file_digest`` / ``file_size``. A ``size`` may
    join a ``status``, because the two come from different reads on a real
    machine: ``{"status": "unreadable", "size": N}`` is the chmod-000 file,
    whose ``stat`` succeeds while its bytes do not. ``dirs`` lists directories
    that exist explicitly (parents of every known path are directories
    implicitly — the list is how *empty* directories are stated). ``symlinks``
    maps link paths to their targets (absolute, or relative to the link's
    directory). ``cores`` maps ``.so`` paths to core-answer objects
    (``{"library_name": ...}``); a path mapped to ``None`` is a core that is
    present but unloadable. ``appimages`` and ``ps2_bios_headers`` model two
    content reads at the seam rather than as bytes — see
    :meth:`read_appimage_text` and :meth:`read_ps2_bios_header`.

    Two lists say what cannot be read, and which one applies is decided by one
    question: does the ``stat`` succeed?

    - ``unlistable`` — it does. The path *is* a directory and its contents
      cannot be read, which is what **a mode-000 directory answers about
      itself**: ``stat`` succeeds, so it is a directory, and the listing fails.
      Mode 111 behaves the same from outside, and shows the shape plainly — a
      wildcard finds nothing there while a name atlas already knows still
      answers. This is the list the resolver's failure paths run through,
      because reaching them means passing an "is it a directory?" check first.
    - ``inaccessible`` — it does not, so nothing about the path can be told.
      This is what the paths *below* a mode-000 directory answer, and what a
      mount point answers once the card behind it stops responding (``EIO`` on
      the stat). Declaring a directory declares its whole subtree, because the
      failing ``stat`` is the one every path below it needs first.

    So a mode-000 directory is ``unlistable``, and it is the wrong list that is
    tempting: putting the directory in ``inaccessible`` makes the directory
    itself unreachable, and a resolver then refuses it long before it would
    have tried to read it. Naming a path in both is not a mode-000 shorthand
    but a contradiction, and it fails construction rather than resolving to
    either — a precedence rule would be a documented way to describe the wrong
    machine quietly. Where a mode-000 directory's children matter, they are
    named in ``inaccessible`` individually; the directory itself is not.

    Every operation resolves the path it is given the way the module docstring
    states the kernel does — symlink components, ``.``, ``..`` and separator
    spellings alike — because the store is keyed by one path per file while a
    machine answers for every spelling that reaches it. So a link to a target
    that is not in the fixture is a *dead* link (``readlink`` shows it,
    ``path_kind`` says missing, exactly like the real thing), and a fixture
    cannot answer *missing* for a file the real machine hands over under a
    ``.``, a ``..``, a doubled separator or a trailing slash.

        The one rule the failure spellings fall out of: before the walk steps
        *through* a place, that place must be a directory. So ``f.txt/`` and
        ``f.txt/../g`` are ``ENOTDIR`` while ``dir/`` and ``dir/./`` are the
        directory, and a ``..`` climbs from where the walk landed rather than
        from the spelling — ``link/..`` is the link target's parent.

        This is a resolution, not a normalization: collapsing the spelling
        first (``os.path.normpath``) would eat the component in front of a
        ``..`` even when that component is a symlink, and the kernel does the
        opposite. Nothing here consults the *final* component's kind; that is
        the caller's question, and a dangling final component is a dead link,
        not a refusal.

        A relative path names nothing: the real machine resolves it against the
        working directory of the process, which is not a fact about the machine
        being described, so a fixture has nowhere to start. (One reaches here —
        ``system_directory = "system"`` is checked for being a directory before
        it is refused for not being absolute.)

        This walk exists three times, for three different jobs:
        :func:`atlas.firmware.resolve_links` resolves a path *through* the seam
        for a caller that then reads it, and
        ``atlas.installations._resolve_symlink_chain`` also collects the links
        it traversed so a caveat can name them. They deliberately differ — only
        this one refuses to step through a non-directory, because only this one
        answers for the paths themselves — but a fidelity finding about
        symlinks, ``..`` or the hop limit belongs in all three, and they share
