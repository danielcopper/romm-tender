"""Rule cards for cores whose save behaviour deviates from the standard rule.

The cards live in ``data/core_oddities.json`` — world knowledge under the
boundary rule: a card states *which* live config governs a core and what its
values mean; the current value is always read from the machine, never from the
card. Cards are keyed by the core's canonical short name (the ``.so`` basename
without ``_libretro.so``), which is also where the ``.so`` name comes from — it
is derived, not restated, so the two cannot disagree. The ``identifiers`` block
carries the display ``library_name`` the binary reports, so lookup works from
either side.

A card states only what no read of the machine recovers. Everything it does
state about a core's own vocabulary is machine-checked where a machine can
check it: the option key, its default and its value set against the
registration the deployed core makes, and the recorded file names and subdir
fragments against the literals in the shipped binary (the ``anchors`` block —
validated here, asserted in ``tests/test_oddities.py``).

Facts in data, interpretation in code: this module only loads and indexes; the
resolver in :mod:`atlas.installations` applies the card.

class SaveGroup:
    """One directory's worth of a mode's save, with what it is and whom it belongs to.

    A mode's save is not always one list of files that share a meaning. MAME
    puts a machine's battery memory under ``nvram/``, its dip switches under
    ``cfg/`` beside an emulator-wide ``default.cfg``, and disk write-differences
    under ``diff/``; FinalBurn Neo writes a per-game ``.fs`` and a shared
    ``shared.memcard`` into one directory. Each group therefore carries its own
    ``subdir``, its own ``granularity`` and a ``role`` saying what kind of data
    it holds — two fields rather than one, because "whose is it" and "what is
    it" are different questions and MAME's two ``.cfg`` files answer them
    differently while sharing a directory.

    The evidence fields are per group for the same reason: a card can have
    read one part of a save to the source and another only far enough to name
    it, and a scope that covers the whole mode would be wrong about one of them.

    ``unnamed`` is the third state a group's file list can be in, and it is not
    the same as the other two. A group with it states a directory this
    configuration writes save data into whose **names do not follow from
    anything atlas reads** — MAME's differencing images for CHD hard disks take
    the disk image's own name out of the machine's ROM table inside the binary.
    Such a group reaches the answer as a :class:`~atlas.placement.FileGroup`
    with ``files=None``, so one walk over ``groups`` covers every place the
    save lives, and the ``file-names-unestablished`` caveat rides beside it
    with this text as the citation — the sentence a person reads and the
    reason behind it. Silence would be worse than either: a backup that skips
    the directory loses the player's progress on every machine with a hard
    disk.

    ``files`` is the declared set, or ``None`` when the card marks it
    unverified — the resolver then refuses to state filenames.
    A name may be a template: ``<rom_stem>`` the resolver fills from the
    content path, ``<save_id>`` it carries through as a hole for the caller.
    ``observe`` optionally widens the *observation* candidates beyond the
    declared defaults (e.g. Flycast's slot-2 VMUs, which exist only when a
    controller port's slot 2 is configured as a VMU). ``complete`` asserts
    that the group's candidate universe is closed — no other file can belong
    to it; a card may claim it only with source-verified provenance.

    ``root`` anchors the group at a *different* root than its mode — Flycast
    keeps the console flash and the unmoved shared cards under the system
    directory's ``dc`` while a per-game mode's own answer lives under the
    save root (issue #97). ``None`` — every group's ordinary state — means
    the mode's root; the loader refuses a restated one, since it could only
    ever disagree. A cross-root group reaches the caller through
    ``file_set.groups`` where the set is declared, and always through the
    ``file-set-spans-roots`` caveat, whose data names the resolved directory
    and the files — the caveat is what survives an observed answer, exactly
    the way ``file-names-unestablished`` carries MAME's unnamed tree.

    (see :class:`SaveGroup`); the first is the mode's own state, the one a
    save-syncing client would take if it read nothing else. The fields a mode
    carried before the save could have several parts are still here as the
    first group's, so one spelling stays one spelling — they are read off
    ``groups[0]`` rather than stored twice.

    ``files`` is the declared file set for this mode, or ``None`` when the
    card marks it unverified — the resolver then refuses to state filenames.
    A name may be a template: ``<rom_stem>`` the resolver fills from the
    content path, ``<save_id>`` it carries through as a hole for the caller.
    ``observe`` optionally widens the *observation* candidates beyond the
    declared defaults (e.g. Flycast's slot-2 VMUs, which exist only when a
    controller port's slot 2 is configured as a VMU). ``complete`` asserts
    that the mode's candidate universe is closed — no other file can belong
    to the save; a card may claim it only with source-verified provenance.

    Two fields state what a single file list cannot:

    - ``files_without_save_id`` is the same set as the emulator names it when
      the content carries no platform-native id — Flycast falls back to the
      ROM's own name for arcade content and for a disc whose header states no
      id (``oslib.cpp:44`` vs ``:62``). The set is genuinely conditional on a
      fact atlas does not read, so the resolver states the id-keyed set and
      hands the alternative to the caller in a caveat instead of picking one.
    - ``files_established_for`` names the class of content the list itself was
      established for — one token from
      :data:`~atlas.placement.FILES_ESTABLISHED_FOR_TOKENS`, because it reaches
      a client as the value it decides on. ``files_established_note`` is that
      class spelled out for a person, and ``files_citation`` cites it. Not every
      difference between content classes is a spelling: Flycast connects four
      VMUs on a Dreamcast and two on a Naomi board, so for arcade content two of
      the four declared names can never exist. The token travels into the same
      caveat's data and the note into its message, so the list is never read as
      established for content it was not.
    A group may anchor at a different root than its mode (``SaveGroup.root``)
    — the spanning-save answer that retired the old ``also_under`` field: the
    mode states every part with its files instead of naming a second root it
    cannot list (issue #97).

    ``writes_discarded`` is the third body a mode can have, beside ``groups``
    and ``inside_content``: the configuration keeps no save at all — the
    writes are discarded (hatari with write protection on throws the modified
    image away at eject). Like ``inside_content`` it is required prose that
    replaces the groups; unlike it, the declared emptiness it produces is the
    whole truth, so its granularity is ``"none"`` rather than the content
    file's own per-game grouping.
