"""ES-DE catalogue parsing — which emulators can launch which system, live.

``es_systems.xml`` is the *choice* source of the emulator catalogue: per system,
the launch entries in declared order, first entry = ES-DE's default. Two layers
are read live through the machine seam and merged:

1. the bundled file (inside the frontend's installation), then
2. the user overlay ``<ES-DE home>/custom_systems/es_systems.xml`` — a system
   defined there **replaces** the bundled system of the same name (ES-DE
   USERGUIDE, "Game System Customizations"); new names are added.

Unless the overlay opts out of the merge altogether: a document-level
``<loadExclusive/>`` in the custom file makes ES-DE skip the bundled file
wholesale (``SystemData::loadConfig``, ``es-app/src/SystemData.cpp:858-895``,
ES-DE v3.4.1), so the custom layer *is* the catalogue then. The parser states
the tag's presence on the layer (:class:`CatalogueLayer`); honoring it — only
ever for the custom layer, exactly as ES-DE does — is the callers' work.

A command containing ``*_libretro.so`` is a libretro entry (the ``.so`` basename
is extracted); anything else is a standalone entry. Classification only — no
path knowledge is derived from the command text.

Honest degradations: a missing layer is skipped; a malformed layer is skipped
the same way (recorded per answer as its absence — structured catalogue error
reporting is on the task list). The user's saved per-system emulator choice
(``es_settings.xml``) is **not** read yet: its key format is unverified — the
declared order is the answer until then (task list).

Pure text in, entries out. No I/O.

Parsing uses the stdlib deliberately: the input is local config from the user's
own machine (not attacker-controlled in this threat model), modern expat
(Python ≥ 3.11) rejects entity-expansion attacks — surfacing as ``ParseError``,
i.e. an honestly skipped layer — and ``dependencies = []`` is a design contract
(DESIGN.md, consumption), so ``defusedxml`` is not an option. What the reads go
through is :mod:`atlas._xml`, that same expat with ElementTree's shape around
it: the wrapper package ``xml.etree`` is an assumption a frozen consumer runtime
breaks (issue #339), while the parser underneath is the one ElementTree itself
has always parsed with.

    This mirrors ES-DE's own walk (``SystemData.cpp:1028-1071`` @ v3.4.1)
    rather than approximating it, because ``declared_index`` claims to *be* the
    position the frontend holds — and the frontend does not simply number the
    elements. Three rules shape the list it builds, and the **label** decides
    every one of them; the command's text is never consulted here:

    * A **duplicate label** is dropped and takes no position. The store at
      ``:1067-1069`` runs only ``if (!duplicateLabel)``, and the comparison at
      ``:1056-1066`` is against every label kept so far. Numbering the elements
      would put each later one a slot too high.
    * A ``<command>`` carrying **no ``label`` attribute**, once anything is
      kept, **ends the walk**: ``:1031-1038`` ("only the first command tag will
      be processed") where one entry is kept, ``:1039-1046`` ("no additional
      command tags will be processed") where more are. Its mirror image ends
      the walk too — ``:1048-1055`` fires on a *labelled* element whose
      predecessor was kept under an empty label. Between them, a first
      ``<command>`` with no label makes the system a one-entry system whatever
      follows, because the second element trips one branch or the other. Two
      things leave that predecessor's label empty and so arm ``:1048``: a
      ``label=""``, and an absent attribute, which ``as_string()`` also reads
      as ``""`` when the element is stored at ``:1069``. ES-DE's own comment at
      ``:1049`` names the second. The test at ``:1030`` is on the attribute's
      **presence**, which is why ``label=""`` counts as a label and reaches
      ``:1048`` rather than ``:1030``.
    * Anything else is kept **whatever its text is**: ``:1068-1069`` stores
      ``entry.text().get()`` with no emptiness test at all. An element with no
      text, or with only whitespace, is a launch command of ``""`` that holds
      its slot in ``mLaunchCommands`` (``:1139``) and still draws its own row
      in the alternative-emulator list
      (``GuiAlternativeEmulators.cpp:153-205``). The emptiness that does reach
      a command *list* is the list's own: ``:1114`` skips a system declaring no
      ``<command>`` at all, alongside a missing fullname, path or extension —
      as ``:1109`` skips one with no name.

    A commented-out ``<command>`` reaches none of this and takes no position:
    this walk and ES-DE's both step through children **by name**
    (``system.child("command")``, ``next_sibling("command")``), and no comment
    node answers to one. That is the common case rather than a corner one —
    RetroDECK's bundled catalogue comments out the standalone entries of many
    systems.

    argument (``es-app/src/FileData.cpp:289``). That is plain text
    substitution, not a shell's tilde grammar: a bare ``~`` becomes the home,
    ``~user`` looks no user up and becomes the home with ``user`` glued on,
    and a ``~`` in the middle of the value is replaced just the same.
    Mirroring it exactly is the point — for these spellings the substituted
    string *is* the directory the frontend launches from, odd or not, and a
    stricter atlas would refuse a machine ES-DE runs fine on.

    One pass, not the collapse loop: ``Utils::String::replace``
    (``es-core/src/utils/StringUtil.cpp:267-297``) rewrites every occurrence
    left to right, and its outer loop cannot rescan this call — after one
    pass no ``~`` from the input remains, and a *home* that itself carried
    one would hit the endless-loop break (``:293-294``). Python's
    ``str.replace`` has exactly that shape, where the ``//`` collapse above
    needed the loop spelled out.

    The *home* is an argument because establishing it is the caller's work,
    per arrangement: ``getHomePath()`` (``FileSystemUtil.cpp:183-229``)
    answers the ``--home`` a launcher passed (RetroDECK's relocated config
    home) or ``$HOME`` (EmuDeck's plain one), and this module does no I/O.

    Follows ``SystemData::loadConfig()`` (``es-app/src/SystemData.cpp``, ES-DE
    3.4.1, ~L859-861, line numbers read from the tagged source over the web):
    the token is replaced with the ROM directory, then ``//`` is collapsed —
    **unconditionally**, on a path that carried no token just the same, which is
    why the collapse here is not inside the substitution branch.

    The directory is normalized to exactly one trailing separator first, because
    that is the shape ES-DE substitutes: ``FileData::getROMDirectory()``
    (``es-app/src/FileData.cpp:271-305``, ES-DE 3.4.1) appends one where the
    configured value lacks it (``:291-297``) and returns the empty-setting
    default with one already on (``:283-284``). Doing it here rather than appending unconditionally keeps a
    configured ``…/roms/`` from spelling the answer ``…/roms//n64``.

    A declared path carrying no token needs no directory and resolves to
    itself: ES-DE insists on the token only in ``createSystemDirectories()``
    (~L1366, the placeholder-generation path), never when loading the
    catalogue, so a literal ``<path>`` is a real path here too.

    ``None`` when the token is present and *rom_directory* cannot stand in for
    it: unset, or not absolute. ``~`` expansion is deliberately not this
    function's job — what a ``~`` becomes is ES-DE's own home, which only the
    caller has established, so the handles expand first
    (:func:`expand_home_path`) and a value still carrying one here was never
    expanded. It is refused with the rest of the relative shapes rather than
    guessed at, because a ROM directory guessed wrong is a directory the
    caller would go looking in.

    The per-system selection lives in one of two places, and atlas reads it

    first, the ``<gameList>`` child as the fallback
    (``es-app/src/GamelistFileParser.cpp:190-192``, ES-DE commit ``9207fc77``):

    1. as a **second root element** before ``<gameList>`` — what ES-DE writes
       today (``doc.prepend_child``, same file line 420 when updating an
       existing gamelist and line 444 when creating one), and not well-formed

       range over the file).

    Deeper in the tree — inside a ``<game>`` — is not a place ES-DE looks for
    the *system* selection (a game's own choice is ``<altemulator>``), so the
    lookup stays depth-bounded instead of searching the whole document.

    Wrapping in a synthetic root parses the two-root quirk and well-formed
    variants alike; a leading UTF-8 BOM is stripped first, because pugixml
    reads a BOM'd gamelist normally and inside the wrapper the mark would
    fail the whole file — selections ES-DE honors would read as none set.
