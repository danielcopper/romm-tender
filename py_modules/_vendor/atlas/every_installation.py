"""Asking every installation at once — the aggregate over :func:`atlas.detect`.

Choosing an installation is optional here, not abolished. A machine can carry
RetroDECK and a native RetroArch side by side, and "where does this save live?"
then has two true answers — one per arrangement, PPSSPP once with the RetroDECK
wiring and once with the native one. :class:`EveryInstallation` asks all of them
and hands back every answer, each labelled with the handle that produced it.
Returning every true answer is not guessing; picking a winner would be, which is
why nothing here merges, deduplicates or prefers. A one-installation machine
yields a one-entry result, and the caller still never chose.

The aggregate adds nothing to an answer. It delegates every question to the
handles unchanged, in the order :func:`~atlas.detect.detect` returned them
(documented probe order, highest priority first), so a labelled answer is
byte-identical to the one the handle route gives for the same question. Every
resolver rule stays where it is resolved — in the handle — which makes this the
one question-answering surface in atlas that reads nothing off the machine
itself: it holds no seam and performs no read.

Three consequences worth stating, because each is a decision:

- **The label is the handle**, not a copy of its identity. A consumer that wants
  to drill down asks it the next question (``emulators_for``, then the entry's
  own ``savefile_location``), which a detached ``(kind, root)`` pair cannot answer;
  and identity read off a handle is a live read, which a snapshot taken at
  fan-out time would silently age. So ``kind``, ``kinds`` and ``root()`` are
  reached through the label instead of being fanned out. ``health()`` *is*
  fanned out: it is a reading of the installation's state, not a name for it,
  and a caller checks it before trusting the answers beside it.
- **An empty machine answers with nothing, and that is a result.** It is
  :func:`~atlas.detect.detect`'s own empty answer, which has exactly one
  meaning: no marker was found. Detection triggers on marker *existence*, so a
  present-but-broken installation still yields a handle and never hides inside
  this empty — and every other kind of empty is a per-installation answer
  object that says which kind it is.
- **Exceptions are not converted into answers.** A handle that raises ends the
  fan-out the way it would end a direct call; the aggregate does not invent an
  answer shape for "this one handle failed", because that would be a resolver
  decision made outside a resolver.
