"""Firmware — which emulator wants which file, where it goes, and what lies there.

Firmware knowledge splits exactly along atlas's boundary rule, and this module
is where the split is made visible:

- **Which files a core wants is on the machine.** RetroArch ships a ``.info``
  file next to every core, and it declares that core's firmware
  (``firmwareN_path`` / ``firmwareN_desc`` / ``firmwareN_opt``) and its
  ``systemname``. So the declarations are *read*, live, from the installation's
  own ``libretro_info_path`` — never from a shipped table that drifts against
  the cores actually installed.
- **What a correct file's bytes are is written nowhere on the machine.** The
  ``md5``/``sha1``/``size`` triple comes from libretro-database's
  ``System.dat``, and stays a packaged, versioned, source-cited lookup
  (``data/firmware_hashes.json``). "No hash known" is a normal state, not an
  edge case: ``System.dat`` covers only part of the firmware universe. Each
  entry also states its ``kind``, because 24 of the 388 are archives — romset
  zips, plus data packs and program jars released and versioned with the project
  that builds their core — whose whole-file hash pins a packaging rather than a
  content. That statement is atlas's own [D] reading,
  curated in ``scripts/generate_firmware_hashes.py`` and versioned there;
  nothing in atlas decides a kind from a file extension.

The model is **emulator-centric**, because a firmware requirement is a property
of an emulator and of nothing else::

    System            snes, dreamcast, gb
      └─ Emulator     mgba, sameboy, flycast   ← decides BOTH the demand AND the place
           ├─ need         required | optional
           ├─ path         absolute destination + expected file name
           └─ identity     expected bytes — judges what is actually lying there

The hash is not a level above the name: the *emulator* decides the name and the
path, the *hash* decides whether what sits there is the right thing. Two cores
on one machine routinely want the same bytes under different names — gambatte
asks for ``gb_bios.bin``, SameBoy for ``dmg_boot.bin``, and the packaged table
carries both under one md5. A byte-identical file under the *other* name does
**not** satisfy the requirement (SameBoy opens ``dmg_boot.bin`` and nothing
else), so ``missing`` stays ``missing`` — what the shared identity buys is a
better instruction: copy what you already have instead of downloading it.

Two axes, kept apart on purpose (:class:`FirmwareRequirement`):

- ``need`` — ``required`` or ``optional``, straight from ``firmwareN_opt``.
  It says what an emulator asks for, never what is on disk.
- ``present`` / ``checked`` — what the machine answers. ``checked`` keeps
  **five** values: ``verified`` and ``mismatch`` are results, ``unchecked``
  means the identity is known but verification was not asked for, ``unknown``
  means it cannot be established at all, and ``not-comparable`` means the
  identity is not the kind a whole-file hash can judge — an archive whose bytes
  move with its packaging — so a difference from the pinned bytes is no verdict
  at all. "We did not look" and "we looked and cannot tell" must never collapse
  into one value, and neither may "we looked, they differ, and that settles
  nothing".

The invariant that ties the two together: ``checked is None`` exactly when
``present is not True`` — nothing at the destination, or a look that did not
happen, leaves nothing to check.

*Unknown* is deliberately not a ``need``. Having no declaration to check
against is a property of the answer, not of a file, so it is a
:class:`~atlas.placement.Caveat` attached to an answer whose requirement list
is **empty**. A caller that ignores caveats then gets an empty list rather than
a satisfied one: empty is honest, "nothing missing" would be a lie. Which
caveat says *which kind* of empty this is, and there are three
(:func:`_empty_answer_caveat`): :data:`CAVEAT_NO_FIRMWARE_DECLARATION` —
nothing declares it and that was read; :data:`CAVEAT_NO_FIRMWARE_REQUIREMENT` —
declarations exist and none became a requirement;
:data:`CAVEAT_FIRMWARE_DECLARATION_UNKNOWN` — what is declared could not be
established at all.

# surfaces (``menu_displaylist.c:880`` and ``ui_qt.cpp:1238``, of which the

# name (core_info.c:2381-2383, :func:`_join_under`) that answers the same for a

# ``firmwareN_desc`` beside the path is not asked either, and that one is a
# deliberate refusal rather than an absence: LRPS2's reads "'pcsx2/bios'

# writes, so reading "folder" out of it would be a guess dressed as a fact.

# existed, never a wrong statement about a core nobody has read. Rows are added
# one core at a time, with the citation in the comment above them.
#
# Version 1 stated the shape alone. Version 2 states what the core accepts
# INSIDE the folder — the size filter it applies and the packaged identities it

# left at ``satisfied: None`` (:class:`DeclaredDirectory`). Version 3 names
# the content read the core makes over each file the size filter kept, so a

    #     "/pcsx2/bios"), "*", FILESYSTEM_FIND_FILES, &results)``,
    #     libretro/main.cpp:1801-1807 — to fill the ``pcsx2_bios`` core option
    #     with the images it found;
    #   - ``retro_load_game`` sets ``EmuFolders::DataRoot`` to
    #     ``<system>/pcsx2`` (libretro/main.cpp:1905-1913), under which
    #     ``EmuFolders::LoadConfig`` resolves the ``Folders/Bios`` default
    #     ``"bios"`` (pcsx2/Pcsx2Config.cpp:1040-1042, :1051-1061) and
    #     ``EnsureFoldersExist`` creates it with ``path_mkdir`` when it is not
    #     there (:1070-1073);
    #   - the image itself is a NAME inside it — ``FullpathToBios`` joins the
    #     chosen file onto that folder (pcsx2/Pcsx2Config.cpp:994-998).
    # The shipped ``pcsx2_libretro.info`` says the same in libretro's own words:
    # ``firmware0_desc = "'pcsx2/bios' folder"`` over ``firmware0_path =
    # "pcsx2/bios"``, with ``notes`` [1] "This only checks if the PCSX2 'bios'
    # folder exists and is in the correct location." and [2] "Because the core
    # doesn't require any specific filename for the BIOS files, this info file
    # cannot tell you if the content of your 'bios' folder is correct or not."
    #
    # What the core does with the listing, same revision:
    #   - it lists whenever the core has not yet read a ``pcsx2_bios`` value in
    #     this loaded instance (``setting_bios`` empty, libretro/main.cpp:1801)
    #     — the first ``retro_init`` after the core is loaded, since the option
    #     is read at content load (``check_variables``, main.cpp:360-365,
    #     called from ``retro_load_game`` at :1926, after ``retro_init`` at
    #     :1789) and nothing clears it afterwards (``retro_deinit`` :1412-1420
    #     included), so a re-init without unloading skips the listing —
    #     NON-recursively,
    #     ``"*"`` with ``FILESYSTEM_FIND_FILES`` and no hidden-files flag
    #     (main.cpp:1807), where DuckStation's search asks for hidden names too
    #     and this one does not. The option does not stop the listing: set,
    #     ``LoadBIOS`` opens the named file rather than the first the listing
    #     found, with no size filter (BiosTools.cpp:281-306, only
    #     ``filesize > 0``), so the size verdict below is a verdict about the
    #     auto-detect path;
    #   - it keeps only files with ``MIN_BIOS_SIZE <= size <= MAX_BIOS_SIZE``,
    #     4 MiB and 8 MiB (libretro/main.cpp:1810-1816; the same constants in
    #     pcsx2/ps2/BiosTools.cpp:31-32), and validates each survivor by
    #     content with ``IsBIOS`` (main.cpp:1818; BiosTools.cpp:325-335), which
    #     reads the ROMDIR header (``LoadBiosVersion``, BiosTools.cpp:60-173 —
    #     the read :mod:`atlas.ps2_bios` performs step for step). No hash
    #     table anywhere: any file the header check passes is an image;
    #   - it needs exactly ONE image. The first found becomes the ``pcsx2_bios``
    #     option's default (main.cpp:1832-1834); ``LoadBIOS`` opens one file
    #     (BiosTools.cpp:281), and when the configured one is absent
    #     ``FindBiosImage`` returns the first file passing ``IsBIOS`` regardless
    #     of region (BiosTools.cpp:241-250; the fallback :270-278). So one
    #     recognised image satisfies the declaration, and several are more

    # The packaged identities under ``pcsx2/bios/`` (73 in the packaged table

    it. That way a core whose ``.info`` is missing, unreadable, or not UTF-8

    where the copy at this destination came from — so the repair for a missing
    or damaged one is a reset of that component, not a download. Some of these

    sighting, declared as required firmware, covered by no ``System.dat`` entry,

    because deleting one removes part of the installation rather than a dump
    that can be fetched back. A client that offers to delete or replace firmware

class FirmwareRequirement:
    """One (core, declared file) pair — the atom of the whole model.

    ``path`` is the **absolute, resolved** destination — where the file really
    lands once the kernel has followed every symlink on the way. It is stated
    whether or not a file is there, because "where does this go" is the question
    a download flow asks, and resolving it means two declarations of the same
    file are one place rather than two (LRPS2's ``pcsx2/bios`` *is* the firmware
    root on RetroDECK, so a placing client would otherwise write two copies).
    ``declared`` keeps the string the core spelled, which is the name it will
    open — nothing is lost by resolving.

    ``declared_kind`` says what the core opens the declaration AT — a file it
    reads, or a folder it lists (:data:`FIRMWARE_DECLARED_DIRECTORY`). It is a
    property of the declaration and so survives an empty destination, which is
    the whole reason it is a field: ``found: missing`` on a folder declaration
    is a folder to create, and it is indistinguishable from an absent file
    without it. Where such a folder is there, ``found`` and ``present`` keep
    describing the folder and :attr:`satisfied` is the verdict about what it
    holds, read the way the core reads it (``contents_satisfied``, set by the
    ``.info`` route and never serialized — the answer's caveats carry what
    was seen).

    ``need`` says what the core asks for; ``found`` and ``checked`` say what the
    machine holds. ``found`` is the path kind read at the destination and keeps
    all four apart — a directory in the way is not a missing file, and a path
    that could not be looked at is neither. ``checked`` is ``None`` exactly when
    there is nothing at the destination to check, and otherwise keeps its five
    values apart: ``unchecked`` (identity known, verification not asked for) is
    not ``unknown`` (it could not be established), and ``not-comparable`` (the
    bytes differ and the identity is an archive, so the difference judges
    nothing) is not ``mismatch`` — none of the three is a verdict.

    ``supplied_by`` is a third axis and not a fourth value of the second: it
    says whose file is at the destination, never whether it is right. A
    distribution that places a file into the firmware root itself (RetroDECK's
    Dolphin ``Sys`` tree) leaves something no library can give back, and stating
    that is what keeps a "delete this BIOS" action from throwing it away
    (:class:`SuppliedBy`).

    ``regions`` is ``None`` on an ordinary requirement — every launch needs
    this file — and names the console regions whose launch this file serves on
    an option inside a :class:`FirmwareAlternatives` group, which is the only
    place a region-scoped requirement may stand (:class:`CoreFirmware`
    enforces it). DuckStation is what the field exists for: exactly one of its
    per-region BIOS keys is read per launch, selected by the console region
    the running disc sets (``GetBIOSImage``, bios.cpp:321-338 and
    system.cpp:1613-1648, :2510 at 64655818e), so two named images were never

        0.8 s on the reference machine, so a caller who wants the green light
        can ask for it.

        A file whose identity the table does not cover stays ``True``: nothing
        further can ever be established about it, so withholding the answer

    an absent file, it is a look that did not happen.

    An **archive** identity is checked asymmetrically, and the asymmetry is the
    point. An exact hit on size and md5 still verifies: those bytes are the
    pinned packaging of the pinned version, so a positive establishes the file.
    Any difference establishes nothing at all, because the pinned bytes are one
    romset version at one merge mode, or one core release's data pack, and a

    required rather than defaulted for exactly that reason: a default would be a
    second, quieter source for a name the caller already holds.

    landed. With ``pcsx2/bios`` linked to the firmware root,
    ``pcsx2/bios/../x.bin`` is ``<root>/../x.bin`` to the kernel — outside — and
    ``<root>/pcsx2/x.bin`` to a lexical reading. The kernel opens the file, so
    the kernel's reading is the one that counts.

    The answer is the resolved path. Two declarations that land on the same
    file then look like one place, which is what keeps a placing client from
    writing two copies: LRPS2's ``pcsx2/bios`` *is* the firmware root here.

    A declaration whose last component is ``.``, ``..`` or empty is refused
    before any of that: those name a directory step, not a file. They resolve
    to a perfectly legal directory — for ``sub/..`` the firmware root itself,
    for ``dc/`` the subdirectory — and answering that as a destination would
    state a requirement for a file the core never named, on a path nothing can
    ever be placed at.

    A *root* that is not an absolute path is refused first of all, because it
    is not a bound: the resolver builds every path from ``/``, so a relative
    root resolves to one that contains everything below it and the containment
    check then passes on anything, including a declaration that names a file
    nowhere near the firmware tree.

    A cfg reaches this: ``system_directory = "system"`` is not blank and not
    ``default``, so it survives ``expand_home`` as written, and the sandbox
    translation only rewrites absolute spellings — the relative value arrives
    here unchanged. RetroArch resolves such a root against the working
    directory of the running process, which is not a fact on disk, so atlas
    has no destination to state and says so instead of promoting the value to
    an absolute path it invented. That the root itself is unusable is stated
    separately, by ``firmware-root-missing``.

    A system answer resolves a catalogue's entries one by one, and each

    itself, observing its destinations again. A catalogue that names one core
    under two entries for one system — RetroDECK 0.10.9b's ES-DE catalogue
    lists ps2 with two of its commands on ``pcsx2_libretro.so``, labelled
    ``LRPS2`` and ``PCSX2``
    (components/es-de/share/es-de/resources/systems/linux/es_systems.xml in
    the Flatpak) — therefore observes each destination once per entry, and
    every answer-level caveat that observation carries is stated twice with
    identical data: a declared file whose bytes fail
    (:data:`CAVEAT_FIRMWARE_UNREADABLE`), a destination that cannot be looked

    lists a folder (:data:`CAVEAT_FIRMWARE_PATH_NOT_A_DIRECTORY`), a directory
    where it reads a file (:data:`CAVEAT_FIRMWARE_PATH_OBSTRUCTED`), an
    archive identity whose bytes differ

    codes need a file declaration — the identity check's unreadable file,
    the obstruction and the archive's not-comparable — which is why three of
    the five modeled vectors could not have been written over the ps2 row;
    the vectors model a doubling on psx, dreamcast and gc. The folder read
    memoises itself (:data:`_FolderReads`), so the folder-contents codes were

    :func:`_unread_candidate` and :func:`_unclaimed_identity` each spell
    :data:`CAVEAT_FIRMWARE_UNREADABLE` in their own sentence — and keeping the
    first keeps the sentence of the reader that observed it first. A data
    value can be a read-only mapping — the type permits one, and
    :data:`~atlas.placement.CAVEAT_PER_GAME_ALTERNATIVE_EMULATOR` carries a
    tally under ``emulators``, though no firmware caveat carries one today —

    """PCSX2's expectation: the image named inside the directory named.

    Two settings of one file. ``[Folders] Bios`` gives the directory — the
    same ``LoadPathFromSettings`` shape the memory-card and texture
    directories use, so a relative value resolves against the DataRoot — and
    ``[Filenames] BIOS`` gives the image inside it. An empty name is the
    shipped state rather than a fault: RetroDECK points the directory at its
    BIOS root and leaves the choice to the user. The answer says so, because
    "no BIOS chosen" is why a game would not boot.

    **No per-game statement here, and the reason is an ORDERING rather than a
    layering rule** (#303). Both DuckStation firmware siblings above state their
    per-game layer; PCSX2's does not, and the difference is easy to get wrong.
    ``[Filenames] BIOS`` *is* a layered key — ``FilenameOptions::LoadSave``
    (Pcsx2Config.cpp:1667-1672) is reached from ``VMManager::LoadCoreSettings``
    on ``Host::GetSettingsInterface``, which returns the layered interface
    itself (VMManager.cpp:598-607, :645-648; Host.cpp:173-176). But its only
    consumer is ``LoadBIOS`` (ps2/BiosTools.cpp:317-333, reading
    ``EmuConfig.FullpathToBios()`` at :321), and ``LoadBIOS`` is called from
    exactly one place, **before** the layer for that game exists:

        VMManager.cpp:1398   if (!LoadBIOS())          <- reads the base value
        VMManager.cpp:1427   UpdateDiscDetails(true);  <- installs the layer at :1108

    Nothing re-reads the BIOS afterwards (the only other reader of
    ``FullpathToBios`` compares it to decide a UI relayout,
    ImGui/FullscreenUI.cpp:1029-1034), and no previous game's layer survives to
    the next boot: ``Shutdown`` clears the disc details and calls
    ``UpdateGameSettingsLayer`` with a zero CRC, which installs ``nullptr``
    (:1650), then re-reads settings at :1698 — "clear out any
    potentially-incorrect settings from the last game".

    So a code path being real is not the same as it being reachable, and this
    silence rests on where a call sits rather than on which layer a key comes
    from. **If upstream ever moves the BIOS load after the layer is installed,
    this answer must start speaking** — the same statement its DuckStation
    sibling makes, over ``[Filenames] BIOS``, closing on ``[Folders] Bios``,
    which no per-game file can move (``EmuFolders::LoadConfig``,
    Pcsx2Config.cpp:2280-2316, handed the base layer at both call sites,
    VMManager.cpp:552 and :835). Re-read the ordering before assuming this
    comment still holds at a newer pin.

    level for the word asked about, and on each core for the files filed
    under one. An own spelling nothing files under answers **empty, marked
    and established**: the word is vocabulary, so the emptiness is a machine
    fact — the mark plus :data:`CAVEAT_NO_FIRMWARE_DECLARATION`, the same
    established absence an id's declaration-less emulators state per entry,
    said at answer level here because there is no entry to say it. And
    :data:`CAVEAT_SYSTEM_UNKNOWN` fires only for words in neither vocabulary.
    (``_unknown`` is deliberately not such a word: it marks cores that state
    no systemname at all, a fact about those cores rather than about a
    system, and it keeps its route-dependent behavior.)

    core data trees live under the same root) and drown the signal; this bound
    needs no exclusion list and grows on its own as cores declare new paths.
    Save data the rule cards claim is excluded outright
    (:func:`save_artifact_paths`).

    *accounted* is what a listed folder's read already stated — an image the
    core's test passed, a candidate the table names and the test denies, one
    whose header read did not come back, or one whose digest could not be

    Those files are claimed by that declaration and skipped here exactly as a
    declared destination is, so the
    read failure the folder read stated is not stated again as an unclaimed
    file's; they do not widen the scan, which *claimed* alone bounds.

    Every scanned directory is clamped to the root's subtree, and the root
    itself is the only one that may equal it. A claimed path is resolved and

    land on the root exactly (LRPS2's ``pcsx2/bios``, which RetroDECK links

    firmware tree. Without the clamp a stock RetroDECK scans it, and whatever
    sits there is reported — and with ``verify`` hashed — as unclaimed

    Names beginning with a dot never appear in this list, and that is a
    decision rather than an oversight: a wildcard in the seam's glob does not
    match a leading dot (:mod:`atlas.machine` states the rule normatively, and
    a real ``glob`` behaves the same), and what sits under a dot in a firmware
    tree is tooling residue — a file manager's ``.directory``, a sync tool's
