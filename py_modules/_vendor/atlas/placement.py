"""Placements — resolved directories, honest file sets, and provenance.

A :class:`SavefilePlacement` answers "where does this emulator, configured as it is,
keep the save for this content?"; a :class:`SavestatePlacement` answers the same
question for its savestates. Their shape follows the research findings
(``docs/research/retrodeck-save-placement.md`` §16):

- **Directory and file set are different kinds of knowledge.** The directory
  follows from RetroArch's central path rule and is always resolvable; the file
  set is per-core behaviour with no metadata source. For existing saves atlas
  *observes* the set (``glob("<rom_stem>.*")``); otherwise it is honestly
  ``unknown`` — never guessed. An observation in the ROM's own directory says so
  (``content-dir-observation``): there the content shares the name and no source
  tells the two apart. The old fixed ``<rom_stem>.srm`` filename is
  gone: ``.srm`` is only what RetroArch itself writes, and cores like Beetle
  Saturn write ``.bcr``/``.bkr``/``.smpc`` on their own.
- **A hole is not an unknown.** ``needs`` lists holes the caller fills from the
  content at hand (``content_dir``, ``library_name``, ``save_id``); *unknown*
  means atlas cannot state the value and refuses to guess. Distinct states,
  kept distinct. A hole is not confined to the directory: where a rule card
  names the save's files through the content's platform-native id, the file
  set is a template too and the same hole vocabulary carries it.
- **The root varies** — ``savefile_directory`` (explicit, or the RetroArch
  platform default when unset/reset), the system directory (Flycast VMUs), or
  the ROM's own directory (``savefiles_in_content_dir``). Sorting stages apply
  after root selection regardless of which root was chosen
  (``runloop.c:8785-8841``). The system directory is the one *the core is
  handed*, not the cfg key's value: ``systemfiles_in_content_dir`` — or a key
  cleared to nothing — sends the core to the content's own directory
  (``runloop.c:1958-1999``), so a card rooted there answers
  ``content_directory`` on those machines.
- **Filesystem state is part of the answer** — RetroArch silently reverts to the
  unsorted root when a sorted directory cannot be created (``runloop.c:8844``,
  and its savestate twin ``:8878-8887``); ``caveats`` carries that and every
  other stated degradation.

**Why savestates get their own type.** The directory math is shared to the line
— one upstream function resolves both families side by side
(``runloop.c:8752-8979``) — so the resolution is parameterized rather than
copied. What is *not* shared is the field set, and the reason is structural: the
libretro API hands a core no savestate directory at all (``libretro.h`` defines
``GET_SYSTEM_DIRECTORY``, ``GET_SAVE_DIRECTORY``, ``GET_CONTENT_DIRECTORY``,
``GET_PLAYLIST_DIRECTORY`` and ``GET_FILE_BROWSER_START_DIRECTORY``, and nothing
for states), and RetroArch serializes the state itself. A core therefore cannot
deviate from state placement, no rule card for it can ever exist, and
``granularity`` — which is a card's word about how a *core* groups the data it
writes — has an empty domain here. Carrying it as a permanent ``None`` would be
the blank field this grammar refuses, and it could not even be rescued by a
caveat: there is nothing to report. So :class:`SavestatePlacement` is
:class:`SavefilePlacement` minus that one field, the way :class:`RomPlacement`
already carries the fields its own question has and no others.

Pure compute. No I/O — the installation handles observe the machine and pass
the results in.

    A save is not always one list of files in one place. MAME keeps a machine's
    battery memory under ``nvram/``, its dip switches under ``cfg/`` beside an
    emulator-wide ``default.cfg``, and disk write-differences under ``diff/``;
    FinalBurn Neo puts a per-game ``.fs`` and a ``shared.memcard`` in one
    directory. Those are different data with different owners, and a single
    ``(dir, files, granularity)`` triple has to lie about at least one of them.

    Each group carries its own resolved ``dir`` — groups may sit under different
    roots — its own ``granularity`` and its own ``role``. What a group never
    carries is prose: what a file is *for* beyond its role belongs in the
    answer's ``sources``, not in a field a client would have to parse.

    ``files`` is ``None`` where the emulator writes save data into this directory
    under names that follow from nothing atlas reads — MAME names a hard disk's
    differencing image after the disk's entry in the machine's own ROM table, and
    its memory cards after an index chosen in the emulator's own interface.
    ``None`` and ``()`` are different claims and the difference is the point:
    ``()`` would say *this directory holds nothing*, which is exactly what such a
    group does not say. Read it as "there is save data here and I cannot list
    it": a backup takes the directory whole, and a name-based sync knows it is
    blind there instead of silently skipping the player's progress. The reason

    ``"declared"`` (``files`` come from a verified rule card — world knowledge
    with cited provenance, not a guess), or ``"unknown"`` (``files`` is empty;
    atlas refuses to guess). ``provenance`` says how the state was reached.

    A declared set can itself be a template: where the card names the files
    through the content's own id, the names keep their ``<save_id>`` hole and
    :data:`SavefilePlacement.needs` lists it. Stating the shape in full is not the
    same as claiming the resolved name — it is the directory grammar applied to
    file names.

    *Observed* means a snapshot of matching files currently seen — it never
    implies the whole save. ``complete`` is the explicit completeness claim:
    ``True`` only when a source-verified rule card closes the candidate
    universe for the active mode; the generic observation can never earn it.

    **Today the field is reserved: it is ``False`` on every answer atlas can
    give**, because no shipped rule card claims completeness and none can yet.
    Closing the candidate universe means establishing which files the core can
    write *at all* for the active mode — an upstream read, not an inventory of
    what a card happens to list — and no card's evidence goes that far. The
    field stays in the contract at its honest value rather than being dropped:
    a client must not read "not complete" as "atlas has no opinion", and the
    audit grind can earn a ``True`` here one card at a time without the shape
    of an answer changing.

    ``groups`` decomposes a declared set whose parts differ in kind or owner —
    see :class:`FileGroup`. It is empty wherever nothing decomposed the answer,
    which is every observation, every unknown and every standard-rule
    declaration; empty means *not decomposed*, never *no files*.

    Where it is populated, ``files`` stays exactly what it always was — the
    names lying in ``dir`` — and that is enforced: it must be every group under
    the first group's directory whose names are established, in order. So a
    client that never reads ``groups`` sees no change when a card splits one
    list into two by role, while a client that does gets the parts under the
    other directories too. Cards state the save's own state first, so the first
    group is the one a save-syncing client would have taken anyway.

    **``groups`` is the complete list of places, and ``files`` is one of them.**
    A group whose names are not established carries ``files=None`` and still
    appears here, so a single walk over ``groups`` reaches every directory the
    card knows about — there is no second structure to correlate. A group with
    ``None`` contributes nothing to ``files``, which is what keeps the flat list
    exactly the set of names a caller can look for.

class TexturePlacement:
    """Where this emulator, configured as it is, reads texture packs from.

    The third placement, and the first whose *root* is not RetroArch's to
    choose: a core that supports texture replacement builds the tree itself,
    under a directory it derives from one of the roots RetroArch hands it. So
    the split runs the other way round from the save family — the root is read
    live (the system directory as the core receives it, or the save root as it
    stands), the fragment below it is per-core behaviour no config states, and
    the two are joined here.

    ``dir`` is concrete when every hole is filled and otherwise a template whose
    remaining holes are listed in ``needs`` — the same grammar
    :class:`SavefilePlacement` answers with, and for the same reason: a core
    rooted in the system directory is handed the *content's* directory wherever
    ``systemfiles_in_content_dir`` sends it, so a caller who named no content
    gets ``<content_dir>`` and a hole to fill rather than a directory nobody
    picked. ``physical_dir`` is the link-resolved backing directory where the
    answer is reached through symlinks — the shape every distribution that wires
    a shared texture tree into place produces — and a traversal that ends
    nowhere is a ``dead-symlink`` or ``symlink-loop`` caveat instead.

    Two fields are this question's own, and each is a different kind of
    knowledge:

    - ``enabled`` says whether replacement is switched on **right now**, read
      from the option that governs it: the options file that RetroArch would
      read first, else the default the installed core itself registers. It is
      ``None`` where neither answered — the option is not in any file atlas
      could read *and* the core did not state a default (or registered a value
      outside the ones the card knows). A directory whose feature is off is
      still the right directory, which is exactly why the two facts are separate
      fields rather than one hedged answer.
    - ``keying`` names how the tree below ``dir`` is divided per game
      (:data:`KEYINGS`) and is ``None`` wherever no cited evidence states it.
      It is world knowledge — nothing on the machine spells it — so it follows
      the boundary rule to the letter: cited or absent, never derived into an
      answer.

    ships carry exactly one tree; FBNeo carries three, each a different
    mechanism under one switch, and an answer that named one of them would be
    two-thirds wrong for a caller who has an IPS patch in hand.

    That plurality is deliberate rather than incidental, and it is the shape

    """Which files RetroArch would patch this content with, before any core sees it.

    The family's second question, and the only one whose subject is the
    **content** rather than an emulator: soft patching is the frontend's own,
    it has no directory of its own — the files sit beside the ROM — and no
    configuration key anywhere governs it (a grep for ``soft_patching`` over
    the pinned tree finds none; the one patch-related setting,
    ``notification_show_patch_applied``, governs an on-screen message). What
    could change it is a command line — ``--ips=``/``--bps=``/``--ups=``/
    ``--xdelta=`` force one format, ``--no-patch`` blocks patching entirely
    (``retroarch.c:7458-7465``, consumed ``task_content.c:695-696``,
    ``:1203-1204``) — and no launcher on either arrangement passes one.

    So this answer is exact where the rest of the family hedges: ``candidates``
    is the whole candidate set in attempt order, derived from the content path
    by arithmetic atlas ports rather than from anything it had to look up.

    ``applies`` is the one live per-core reading: RetroArch patches only content
    it loads **into memory**, which is every core that does not need a full path
    (``task_content.c:744-745`` sets the flag from the core's own
    ``retro_system_info.need_fullpath``, ``:1736-1737`` puts it on the content
    element, ``:1469`` skips the memory load — and with it the patch call at
    ``:1195-1215`` — when it is set). ``True`` means this core loads into memory
    and is therefore patched, ``False`` means it never is, ``None`` means atlas
    could not establish it: no core was named, or the core's ``.info`` states no
    ``needs_fullpath``, or it could not be read (which says so in a caveat).

    Two further gates ride every ``True`` and are stated in prose rather than in
    fields, because neither is a fact about this machine: only the **first**
    content file is patched (``idx == 0``), and only when it is not a media type
    (``first_content_type == RARCH_CONTENT_NONE``, ``task_content.c:1195-1198``).
    A single-file launch — what every launcher on both arrangements performs —
    meets both.

    **Nothing here is written to disk.** The patch is applied to the in-memory
    buffer the core is handed (``task_patch.c:872-879``); the ROM beside the
    patch file is not modified, and no answer of atlas's is a statement that it
    will be.
