"""The mods family's packaged knowledge — what no read of a machine recovers.

Two questions share this file, because they are two halves of one subject: where
a mod for this game goes, and which patch files the frontend applies to the
content before any emulator sees it. What they have in common is the boundary
rule — the roots and the switches are read live, and only what is written
nowhere on a machine is packaged here, marked and cited.

What it carries:

- **The mod cards**, in the shape :mod:`atlas.textures` established for texture
  packs and for the same reasons — a card names a root *kind* and the fragment
  below it, never a directory; it names the option that governs the feature but
  never that option's value; and it is refused without provenance. Two things
  are this family's own. A card states one **or several** trees, because an
  emulator may read mods from directories that are different mechanisms rather
  than alternatives (FBNeo's ``patched`` / ``ips`` / ``romdata``), and a tree
  then names its role. And a card may record the **default** of its option: a
  core that registers its options too late for any probe to capture leaves the
  machine stating nothing, and the value written down here is what stands then —
  pinned to the build it was read from, so an update cannot carry it silently.

- **Which patch formats a RetroArch build attempts.** Soft patching as a whole
  is ``HAVE_PATCH`` and its ``.xdelta`` applier ``HAVE_XDELTA``
  (``Makefile.common:260-267`` at RetroArch a79435a), both decided when the
  binary was compiled. No setting, no log and no file on a running machine
  states either, so this is not a live read for any arrangement — it is a fact
  about a shipped build, and the only honest way to carry it is per arrangement,
  pinned to the version of that arrangement it was proven against.

That pin is the same device the texture cards' ``absent_switch`` uses and it is
here for the same reason: a claim about a build must not survive the build
changing. An arrangement whose machine states a different version gets the claim
with ``unverified-version`` beside it; an arrangement with no record at all gets
no claim, and its answer says which formats were left unestablished rather than
assuming the upstream build defaults.

Facts in data, interpretation in code: this module only loads and indexes.
