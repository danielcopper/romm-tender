"""Which arrangements atlas has seen alive — the evidence behind every answer.

Reading a config the way the emulator reads it is one thing; having watched a
real machine of that arrangement do it is another. Atlas's resolver rules are
source-verified against pinned upstream for every arrangement; RetroDECK and
EmuDeck have each been observed end to end on a live installation
(``docs/research/``, and the per-core column in ``docs/research/coverage-matrix.md``),
the bare RetroArch arrangements have not. An answer from an arrangement nobody
has observed is derived, not confirmed — and derived is worth saying out loud,
machine-readably, on the answer itself.

Two rules decide the shape here, both from CLAUDE.md's boundary rule:

- **The claim is about atlas, never about the machine.** The caveat says a live
  observation of the *arrangement* is missing. It does not say the configs were
  guessed (they are read the same way everywhere), and it does not say this
  installation is broken — that is what :class:`~atlas.installations.Health`
  answers, which is why the evidence note deliberately stays out of it.
- **The status is data, not code.** It lives in ``data/arrangement_evidence.json``
  — marked, versioned, source-cited — so the day an arrangement is verified on a
  reference machine, one file changes and the caveat retires by itself. No
  resolver mentions any arrangement's evidence state.

An arrangement absent from the file is unverified: a missing record is not
evidence, and the safe direction is to say so rather than to fall silent. A
handle kind that never gained an entry is a build mistake all the same, and the
test suite refuses it there instead of here.

The record's pinned version is not provenance alone, it is a **tripwire**: a
verified arrangement was verified against one version of itself, and the
machine says which one it runs. When the two differ, every answer says so
(``docs/re-verification.md`` is what closing it takes). Without that comparison
an update to the arrangement would age all of atlas's world knowledge — parser
grammar, path layout, shipped-build behaviour — while the answers stayed as
clean as the day they were confirmed.

    Two states produce a caveat, and they are the halves of one question — has
    anyone watched this arrangement work, and was it *this* arrangement?

    - **Never observed.** One caveat, on the answer itself, so a client
      branching on codes learns it without knowing which arrangements exist.
      The message states what is missing and what is not: the missing part is a
      live observation of the arrangement; the part that is *not* missing is
      the config reading, which is source-verified against pinned upstream
      wherever it runs. A client that renders this as "atlas guessed" would
      report something nobody claimed.
    - **Observed, on another version.** The record pins the version its
      knowledge was confirmed against, and this machine states a different one.
      What that establishes is that the confirmation is old, not that the
      answer is wrong — nothing here re-decides a placement, and the message
      says so while naming the re-verification that is pending.

    *observed_version* is the version the machine states about itself, or
    ``None`` when it states none. The comparison runs only when both sides
    speak, so an arrangement whose machine names no version stays silent — and
    that silence means *no drift established*, not *no drift*. The alternative
    would put a permanent caveat on every answer of an installation that may
    well be current, which claims a comparison nobody made. Where missing live
    versions do decide something — a rule card pinned to one — the per-card
    ``unverified-version`` caveat states that at the point it matters.

    An arrangement verified against the version this machine runs says nothing
