"""Installation handles — every question is asked *of an installation*.

Detection produces these; each answers ``savefile_location`` for its own flavor by
reading the configs that govern it — the same files, in the same order, with the
same fallbacks the emulator itself uses — through the injected machine seam.

- :class:`RetroDeck` — the RetroDECK Flatpak. ``retrodeck.json`` supplies the
  roots and the health check; the bundled RetroArch's cfg (plus its override
  chain) supplies the layout. The cfg is what RetroArch reads, so the cfg is the
  truth; ``retrodeck.json`` is context.
- :class:`EmuDeck` — an EmuDeck arrangement. Its truth is ``settings.sh``; its
  RetroArch is the bare ``org.libretro.RetroArch`` Flatpak, so the handle
  carries both descriptions (``kinds``) — the same RetroArch under two names.
- :class:`BareRetroArchFlatpak` / :class:`BareRetroArchNative` — bare
  RetroArch installs, differing in config location and default set.

Health is reported, not guessed around: a readable config whose root points into
an absent mount (unmounted SD card) yields ``root_missing``, never a
syntactically correct path handed out as if it were usable.

    left standing at all (``runloop.c:1963-1964``). Only otherwise does it get
    the configured directory (``:1992-1997``).

    What "left standing" means is decided before the environment call, and the
    two spellings that clear it are not the same as the key being absent:

    - **Absent** — ``config_set_defaults`` has already put the platform default
      there (``configuration.c:5746-5749``), which on desktop Linux is
      ``system`` under the config tree (``platform_unix.c:2141-2143``, the same

      ``LIBRETRO_SYSTEM_DIRECTORY`` is exported, which wins (``:2137-2140``) and
      which atlas cannot read off a disk — [V] unset on the reference machine,
      [O] anywhere it is set. So an unset key resolves; it is not a hole and
      never was one.
    - **Blank or the literal ``default``** — ``system_directory`` passes
      ``handle_setting = true`` (``configuration.c:1691``), so the generic path
      loop writes whatever the merged config holds, with no directory test
      (``:6532-6538``); ``config_get_path`` copies an empty value through
      (``config_file.c:1202-1216``) and ``default`` is cleared outright
      (``:6834-6835``). Either way the setting is empty and the content
      directory wins — the opposite of ``savefile_directory``, where a blank
      value keeps the standing root.

    A dropped line is stated here for the first time: while an unset key
    surfaced as a hole, the fact spoke for itself; now it resolves silently to
    the platform default, so the line RetroArch refused has to be said out loud

    """The files RetroArch itself writes for this core on this system, or nothing stated.

    The one file set in this resolver that is *not* a look at the directory,
    and deliberately so: what a save is called follows from RetroArch's naming
    rule and the core's own memory ids, both of which hold whether or not a
    file has been written yet. A file lying in the directory is evidence about
    the past — it may be what a core option wrote before it was switched, or
    what a different core left behind — so it cannot carry a present-tense
    claim about where this configuration writes, and it is not consulted here.

    Five things make the declaration stay silent instead, each of them a
    refusal rather than a fallback:

    - **A rule card speaks for this core.** The card is the stronger statement
      — it knows the deviation this record does not model — and two
      declarations of one file set would be a contradiction a client cannot
      resolve. Any card at all silences the record, not merely one whose mode
      declares files: a carded core is a *deviating* core, and a record that
      filled in the file names of a save the card has moved elsewhere would be
      right about the names and wrong about the save.
    - **No content was named**, so the template's ``<rom_stem>`` has nothing to
      fill it and the shape is not the answer.
    - **The core has no record**, which is not "it writes nothing" but "nobody
      has read its source yet".
    - **The system is unknown or not in the record.** A record is keyed by core
      *and* system because one core is not one behaviour, and narrowing by
      guessing which system was meant is the guess this package refuses.
    - **The installed core could not be examined at all.** A record is read
      out of one build's source, and applying it on the strength of a ``.so``
      file name would state a source-verified claim about a binary nobody
      read. That is the decision :func:`_select_card` already makes for a rule
      card in the same state, and for the same reason: the drift tripwire
      below compares against a version, and *no version at all* is not a
      version that matched.

    The granularity comes out of the same record and is not a second claim:
    the standard rule keys every file it writes by the content, so the only
    question left is how many of them there are, and the record answers it.
    ``option_key`` is ``None`` for the reason LRPS2's is — no option governs
    this, so there is nothing for a caller to switch.

    ships declare it, so a state placement that said only "here is the

    Shared by both content-tree families, because the root a core builds a
    texture tree under and the root it builds a mod tree under are the same
    directory reached the same way — what differs is only the fragment below it.
    A second port of this would be a second answer to one question.

    Two kinds reach here, and each is resolved by the route that already owns
    it. ``system_directory`` is *the directory the core is handed*, not the cfg
    key's value (:func:`_core_system_root`) — so a machine with
    ``systemfiles_in_content_dir`` sends the packs to the content's own
    directory, and a caller who named no content is answered with the hole.
    ``savefile_directory`` is resolved by that family's own root selection, and
    for the same reason: ``savefiles_in_content_dir`` sends the core's save
    root to the content's own directory (``runloop.c:8789``), so a texture tree
    built under it goes there too. Reading the cfg key's value instead would
    name a directory RetroArch never hands the core — the mistake commit
    ``02177f2`` fixed for the system directory, in a second place. What is *not*
    taken from that family is the sorting stages — a derivation, decided
    against contrary evidence rather than settled: the sorting redirect runs
    before the core ever sees the directory
    (``docs/research/retrodeck-save-placement.md`` §"sorting stages apply
    before the core", the [V-live] Flycast observation), so a core that builds
    its texture tree lazily under the handed root *would* land under the
    sorted directory. What decides the other way here: both distributions wire
    the texture links at the UNSORTED root while running with content-sorting
    on, and both disable sort-by-core — so the wired tree is the unsorted one
    on every arrangement with a card, and the sorted reading is live only on a
    bare RetroArch, which already rides ``arrangement-unverified``. If a live
    run ever shows a texture tree under a sorted directory, this branch is the
    one to revisit.

    The return type is the system route's, reused rather than copied: what a
    texture root needs from a resolution is exactly what that one already
    carries — the base, the holes it left, whether it can be looked at from
    here, and its provenance. Only ``root_kind`` goes unread, because nothing

    A running game installs ``<DataRoot>/gamesettings/<serial>_<crc>.ini`` as a
    *layer* under the settings interface every core setting is read through
    (:data:`_PCSX2_LAYER`), so a key of any section that ``Pcsx2Config::LoadSave``
    reads can be answered differently for one game than the global ``PCSX2.ini``
    answers it. The directory is the usual ``LoadPathFromSettings`` shape,
    ``[Folders] GameSettings`` defaulting to ``gamesettings`` below the DataRoot
    (Pcsx2Config.cpp:2290).

    What the layer reaches is not "the configuration" — it is exactly the keys
    read through :data:`_PCSX2_LOAD_CORE`. Every ``[Folders]`` key goes through
    a different door and is base-layer only, so the *directories* PCSX2's
    answers name cannot move at all. Saying "per-game overrides may be present"
    and leaving it there would invite a caller to distrust a directory nothing
    can move, which is why each caller passes the *keys* that answer depends
    on, a *read_through* naming the door those keys come through, and a
    *governs* sentence carrying its own citations for both halves — what a
    per-game value does here, and what it cannot touch.

    Which game runs is not a fact atlas holds, so the layer cannot be read
    *for* an answer — but whether one exists at all is a directory listing.
    Silent where the directory holds none, which is the shipped state, and
    silence means this answer holds for every game.

    A listing that *failed* is not that silence. The absence of a caveat here
    is what tells a caller this answer holds for every game, so answering an
    unreadable directory the way an empty one is answered claims exactly what
    was not established — which is why the failure has a code of its own. An
    absolute configured value is translated through the launch's sandbox like
    every other path this configuration names; one with no host spelling is
    that same unread state, because the listing cannot be made from here.

    Nothing here claims a key **is** set: a game ini may carry any section, so

    game this answer cannot name.

    """The per-game ini layers, stated beside a Dolphin-family answer.

    Two facts, and a caller has to be able to tell them apart, so they are two
    codes. The **user** directory is a listing atlas makes: where files sit
    there, ``per-game-overrides-present`` says how many and where, and where the
    listing fails ``per-game-layer-unread`` says the check did not happen — the
    PCSX2 vocabulary unchanged, because the situation is unchanged. The
    **build's** directory is not a listing atlas can make at all: its location
    is compiled into the binary, so ``per-game-build-layer-unread`` states it
    and no count of it will ever appear.

    That second caveat is unconditional, and that is the point. Under the PCSX2
    shape, silence means "this answer holds for every game" — and for a
    Dolphin-family emulator that would be false whatever the user's directory
    holds, because the build ships a layer of its own that is read regardless.
    So a Dolphin answer is never silent here.

    Neither caveat claims a key is actually set. Nothing filters what a game ini
    may carry (the loader sets every mapped key; only ``Save`` filters), so the
    honest statement is that these keys CAN be answered differently for a game
    this answer cannot name — never that any file does so.

    *keys* are section-qualified the way a game ini must spell them: the
    memory-card keys live in ``[Core]``, but ``NANDRootPath`` and ``LoadPath``
    are reached through the free-form ``<System>.<Section>`` parse, and the
    name that parse resolves for ``System::Main`` is ``Dolphin`` — so the
    section is ``[Dolphin.General]``, and ``[Main.General]`` is dropped with a
    warning. *governs* says, in the answer's own terms, what those keys move.

    RPCS3 keeps saves at ``dev_hdd0/home/<user>/savedata`` and Vita3K at

    the selection down nowhere, Vita3K records it in config.yml — so both
    state the user directories the emulator's own listing keeps rather than a
    guess at the one in force, and the assembly is theirs jointly. What
    differs is the words and the citations, which each card supplies, and the
    listing rule itself: RPCS3 keeps a directory by its name and a
    localusername file, Vita3K by a user.xml that loads.

    ``user_root`` is the directory holding the user directories,
    ``first_user`` the one the emulator starts with — used only where nothing
    could be listed, never as a claim that it is the one running.

    ``skipped`` and ``unestablished`` are directories the listing reached and
    the answer does not state as a user: the ones the emulator's own selection
    passes over, and the ones whose deciding file atlas could not look at.
    Each rides into the caveat's data when non-empty. ``no_user_reason`` is
    stated where no user is listed, because "no user directory was found" is
    false of a tree whose directories were all passed over.

    ``user_reason`` is the machine-readable half of ``user_sentence``: *why*
    the running user is or is not settled here. The two emulators do not share
    it, because they do not share the fact — RPCS3 writes the selection down
    nowhere, while Vita3K's configuration records a user id whose effect
    depends on how the launch was made. ``configured_user`` carries that
    recorded id where one exists, so a client reads the emulator's own
    preselection instead of only the directory listing.

    ``headline_user`` names the user whose tree the answer's ``dir`` points
    at, where the caller established one: Vita3K sets it to the recorded user
    exactly when the listing found that user's directory, because a frontend
    launch reopens exactly that user then — and the caller resolves it
    together with the sentence that explains it, so the two cannot drift.
    RPCS3 never sets it: no file records its user, so its headline stays the
    first tree found.

    The launch_ini shape's one resolver (#284). The governing mame.ini is
    wherever the command's ``-inipath`` points — RetroDECK passes
    ``/var/config/mame/ini``, a sandbox spelling this reading translates —
    falling back to the shipped builds' compiled
    ``$HOME/.mame;/app/share/mame/ini`` search path
    (:data:`_MAME_COMPILED_INI_PATH` — the Flathub build define, byte-proven;
    NOT upstream's ``#ifndef`` fallback), and the file is read with MAME's
    own grammar and priority rules
    (:func:`_mame_ini_values`). A relative ``state_directory`` — the compiled
    ``sta`` default when no ini exists — resolves against the working
    directory, which is the command's ``%STARTDIR%`` where it states one and
    an open hole where it does not. Below the root sits one subdirectory per
    machine (``statename``, default ``%g`` = the running system's short
    name, machine.cpp:474-547, :576), which the command's positional system
    word fills — or the content's own stem where the machine IS the ROM
    (``%BASENAME%``).

    That same word names the ``<system>.ini`` MAME layers over mame.ini
    (``cursystem->name``, mameopts.cpp:96), so this reading OPENS it
    (:func:`_mame_driver_layer`) rather than announcing it: it is the highest
    priority ini of the standard set (mameopts.h:38), so a ``state_directory``
    or ``statename`` line there governs and nothing else in the set can
    overturn it. The members that remain unreadable from outside — the
    orientation, screen, source, parent and grandparent inis — are selected by
    driver metadata compiled into the binary, and are stated where files that
    could be them actually sit
    (:func:`_mame_standard_ini_layer`).

    Two facts ride every answer as caveats: whether the launched system's
    driver is flagged MACHINE_SUPPORTS_SAVE is compiled into the binary and
    unreadable here (states are written and warned about either way,
    machine.cpp:927-928), and any per-machine ini layer that was seen but not
    read.

    Every OTHER MAME answer atlas emits stays silent about this layer, and
    each for a reason that was checked rather than assumed:

    * ``savefile``, ``texture`` and ``mod`` refuse with
      ``standalone-unsupported`` before any directory is computed — MAME has
      no save, texture or mod card (``atlas/data/standalone_saves.json``,
      ``texture_packs.json``, ``mods.json`` name no MAME token), so
      ``nvram_directory``, ``diff_directory`` and ``share_directory`` are
      keys atlas states nothing about at all. There is no claim for the layer
      to qualify.
    * ``screenshot`` is the installation's own route answering the frontend's
      screenshot directory (it carries ``no-core`` for every standalone
      entry), not MAME's ``snapshot_directory``.
    * ``rom_location`` answers the arrangement's ROM tree, and every MAME
      command in both catalogues passes ``-rompath`` on the command line
      (OPTION_PRIORITY_CMDLINE = 151, mameopts.h:27-28), which no ini at any
      priority can override (options.cpp:270).
    * MAME has no firmware card, so no firmware answer names it.

        per-system ``alternativeEmulator``, which outranks the declared order.
        A selection naming no declared entry keeps the declared order — ES-DE

        When *content_path* is omitted and the gamelist carries per-game

        ``read`` is not a detail: an empty catalogue because the shipped

        exist, while an empty *lookup* in a catalogue that was read says the
        frontend knows none for that system. The custom overlay is genuinely
        optional, so on the merged path only the bundled layer decides.

        The custom layer is read first because it can end the reading: a
        document-level ``<loadExclusive/>`` there makes ES-DE skip the
        bundled file wholesale (``SystemData.cpp:858-895`` @ v3.4.1 — the tag
        is honored only in ``configPaths.front()``, which is the custom file
        exactly when one exists, and RetroDECK deploys its stub always). So
        atlas does not read the bundled file either: what it declares is not
        in force, and ``exclusive`` — the catalogue then being the custom
        layer alone, complete — is the statement every consumer rides. A tag
        in the *bundled* layer is ignored the way ES-DE ignores it (the
        LogWarning branch, ``:886-895``).

        ``invalid`` is the hardest state (issue #100): a layer atlas read and
        ES-DE cannot load aborts the frontend's whole ``loadConfig``, so the
        catalogue in force is **empty** — read, exclusive of nothing, with
        the health finding naming the file. It is set only where the file's
        bytes were read: a file atlas cannot read may parse fine for the
        frontend, and stays the unread state it always was.

        ``disabled`` (issue #68) is the commented-out systems of the same
        texts this read already holds — the layers in force only, from the
        same single read (a second read could see a different machine): an
        exclusive overlay's comments alone, otherwise the bundled file's and
        the overlay's. An invalid layer contributes nothing — a file the
        frontend refuses wholesale has no "deliberately off" blocks, only an

        The overlay is read first because it can end the reading: a
        document-level ``<loadExclusive/>`` in the custom file makes ES-DE
        skip the bundled layer wholesale — embedded *and* resource-override
        shadow alike, since the skipped path is whatever ``getResourcePath``
        resolved (``SystemData.cpp:858-895,1338-1362`` @ v3.4.1). The
        catalogue is then the overlay alone and **complete**: nothing sealed
        applies, and a broken shadow cannot matter on such a machine because
        the frontend never opens it either.

        On the merged path the bundled layer has two on-machine sources, in
        ES-DE's own precedence. First the per-file resource override
        (``INSTALL.md`` v3.4.1:1125): a file at
        ``~/ES-DE/resources/systems/linux/es_systems.xml`` shadows the
        embedded one for ES-DE itself, so where it exists and parses it *is*
        the bundled layer, on disk — ``complete`` is ``True`` and nothing is
        sealed away. A shadow that exists and cannot be read or parsed is
        ``shadow_broken``: ES-DE loads that file, atlas could not, and what
        the catalogue says is then unknown — the same claim RetroDECK's
        unreadable bundled layer makes. Where no shadow exists, the embedded
        file itself is read **out of the AppImage** (issue #65): the image's
        squashfs is opened by :mod:`atlas.squashfs` at
        ``usr/share/es-de/resources/systems/linux/es_systems.xml`` — the
        path the Linux build loads (``SystemData.cpp:1349-1351``), verified
        against the deployed AppImage — and where that read answers text,
        the catalogue is ``complete`` and nothing is sealed. Every other
        outcome of that read — no AppImage, not an AppImage, no such entry,
        an interpreter without the image's codec (zstd needs a provider — see
        :mod:`atlas.squashfs`), unreadable bytes — leaves the ``sealed`` state
        exactly as it always was: ``complete`` ``False``, the caveat naming
        the sealed layer. A ``<loadExclusive/>`` in the shadow or the embedded
        file is ignored the way ES-DE ignores one in the bundled layer (the
        LogWarning branch, ``:886-895``).

        The overlay is EmuDeck's own write (``emuDeckESDE.sh:18,127``,
        deployed from ``configs/emulationstation/custom_systems/`` and
        path-rewritten at ``:144-145``): unlike RetroDECK's commented-out
        stub, it declares real systems, and per ES-DE's merge semantics a
        system it declares is *exactly* the one the frontend uses — the
        sealed layer cannot contradict a same-name overlay system. EmuDeck
        never writes the tag; carrying one is a user's own edit, honored
        because the frontend honors it.

        ``invalid`` is the hardest state (issue #100), and it outranks
        ``shadow_broken``: a layer atlas **read** and ES-DE cannot load
        aborts the frontend's whole ``loadConfig``, so the catalogue in
        force is empty — with the health finding naming the file. A shadow
        atlas could not read stays ``shadow_broken``: ES-DE may load it
        fine, so what the catalogue says is unknown, never refused.

        emulator flatpak ``--filesystem=host`` (installEmuFP.sh:33). That grant
        is what makes a host path mean what it says; it says nothing about
        where the sandbox's own bind points lead.

        Without an id nothing sandboxes the launch, so every spelling but
        ``/app`` is the host path it names — and ``/app`` is refused, because
        it names a deployed package no launch here runs (#317). ``~`` expands

        The companion cfg is read once and answers both questions asked of it —
        its text builds the context, its status decides the companion health
        finding — so the two can never describe different revisions of it. The
        marker snapshot arrives for the same reason: the caller read it once
        and every part of its answer describes that one revision. The sandbox
        arrives with its ``~`` base composed from the bare Flatpak's override
        files (:meth:`_cfg_sandbox`) — this context's one read of those files.

        The standalone pair the context carries is the arrangement's, not one
        launch's: this seam is asked once for the whole answer while the
        firmware route picks its bases per entry, so the sandbox is built from
        the same arrangement-wide homes the context states beside it and
        establishes no app id. A sandbox spelling in a standalone emulator's
        config is therefore read here as the host path it is not — ``/app``
        refused, ``/var/config`` left standing — where the savefile and
        savestate answers resolve both against the launch's own app (#317).
        Those two are where it shows today: they are the routes whose
        configured-path cards cover emulators the settings table names an id
        for. The texture and mod answers take the same per-launch sandbox and
        would follow the moment one of their cards does.
