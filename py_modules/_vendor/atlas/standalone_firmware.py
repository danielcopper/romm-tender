"""Standalone firmware cards — what a standalone emulator expects beside its content.

A standalone emulator ships no ``.info`` for the firmware route to read, so
which file it probes and where is established from its source at the shipped
release and packaged here — the same split the standalone save cards make
(:mod:`atlas.standalone_saves`): the card states what *can* be, with
citations, and the resolver reads what *is* on this machine. A card names the
XDG base and the emulator-relative path the emulator itself probes — never
the staging spot an arrangement's installer uses, because the emulator's
probe is the only door that matters at run time (Cemu reads its keys at
``GetUserDataPath("keys.txt")`` no matter where an installer parked them).

Cards are keyed by the ``%EMULATOR_…%`` token, like the save cards beside
them, and reach the firmware answer through the catalogue entry's resolved
token — which on EmuDeck is the launcher route's word, variant-gated there.
