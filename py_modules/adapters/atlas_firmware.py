"""Atlas firmware adapters — the seam through which firmware questions reach the resolver.

The single place the vendored `emu-atlas <https://github.com/danielcopper/emu-atlas>`_
resolver is asked what the installed emulators want. Services see a
:class:`domain.firmware_wants.FirmwareCatalogue` or a
:class:`domain.firmware_wants.FolderVerdict` and never an atlas type — which is
not a stylistic choice: ``domain/`` may not import ``_vendor`` at all (the
``domain-stdlib-only`` contract), so the vocabulary and the resolver have to
meet at an adapter.

Two properties of the resolver decide this module's shape:

- **It raises on its own invariant violations** rather than returning a
  degraded answer — a ``ValueError`` out of an answer's ``__post_init__``, a
  strict packaged-data loader — and promises nothing in writing about not
  raising. So every call is wrapped, and a failure becomes a catalogue with no
  placements and ``resolved`` clear. That reads downstream as "nothing could be
  established", never as "nothing is needed": the second would clear a real
  BIOS warning off a game that cannot launch without the file.
- **It never logs.** Caveats are its whole degradation channel, and their
  ``code`` is the stable half of that contract while ``message`` is prose that
  may change freely. The codes are carried on the catalogue and traced through
  the injected debug logger; nothing here parses a message.

Two questions, and their scopes are the cost model. ``firmware_inventory()``
answers the whole machine unverified in 115-325 ms and memoises nothing, so
asking it once per platform would multiply that by the platform count;
``firmware_for_core(..., verify=True)`` reads the candidate files inside one
core's declared folder, which is affordable per core and is not what the
inventory would do under verification — there the sweep takes in every
unclaimed file under the BIOS root as well. Nothing is cached in either — a
firmware answer is about files on disk that the user is actively adding and
removing, and a cached one would outlive the download that changed it.

Both resolve **one entry per core**, and neither reads the frontend's emulator
catalogue: the inventory walks the installed ``.so`` files, one entry each,
reading every core's ``.info`` for what it declares, and the per-core question
takes the single core whose stem matches. A third question would not —
``firmware_for_system`` resolves a core once per catalogue entry, and an ES-DE
catalogue can list one core under two of a system's entries — so an answer from
it carries a core twice, and every piece of per-destination indexing below would
have to be read again in that light before it could be believed.

    only *lister* — ``firmware_inventory`` also sweeps for unclaimed files,
    globbing the firmware root and every directory a declared file sits in —
    but that sweep records a listing it could not make under ``path``, so its

    The resolver states ``dir`` more widely again: a standalone emulator's

    Nothing here guards against one statement arriving twice, and nothing has
    to: the resolver states an identical ``code`` and ``data`` once on an
