"""RetroDECK paths adapter — reads retrodeck.json for path resolution.

Provides path resolution for saves, ROMs, BIOS, and the RetroDECK home
directory. The adapter reads ``retrodeck.json`` (RetroDECK's user-facing
configurator output) once and caches the result for 30 seconds — long
enough to amortize repeated reads during a sync run, short enough to
pick up edits made via the RetroDECK configurator within a single
plugin session.

Path getters are best-effort and never raise: a missing, unreadable, or
malformed ``retrodeck.json`` falls back to ``<user_home>/retrodeck/*``.
On an SD-card install that fallback root is wrong, so the silent
fallback is paired with :meth:`RetroDeckPathsAdapter.config_health`,
the loud signal ``main.py`` surfaces to the frontend banner.

Every root is symlink-resolved, whichever of the two sources answered.
The content roots are handed to the path guards as safe roots, and the
ROM paths those guards are asked about are recorded resolved wherever
``lib.path_safety.safe_join`` built them — so a root left as
``retrodeck.json`` spells it makes one directory look like two on any
system where ``/home`` is a link to ``/var/home``, and a ROM recorded
inside the root is refused as outside it (#1838).

The home is not a safe root, and is resolved for its own reason:
``MigrationService`` diffs it against the home it stored to decide
whether RetroDECK moved, and two spellings of one directory are not a
move.

``realpath`` on a path that is not on disk resolves as far as it can and
normalizes the rest rather than raising, so the getters keep their
best-effort, never-raises contract. Normalizing is not nothing: the
home's ``<user_home>/retrodeck/`` fallback loses its trailing separator,
which is what a prefix match wanted anyway.
