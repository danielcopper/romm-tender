# decky-romm-sync — Decky Loader Plugin

## What This Is

A Decky Loader plugin that syncs a self-hosted RomM library into Steam as Non-Steam shortcuts. Games launch via
RetroDECK. The QAM panel handles settings, sync, downloads, and BIOS management.

## What belongs in this file

Three things, and nothing else:

1. **Traps** — where an agent would confidently do the wrong thing and have no reason to go look first.
2. **Cross-cutting invariants** — rules that span files, so no single diff shows the whole rule.
3. **Workflow** — how we work here; not derivable from the code.

Everything else is topic depth: `docs/` for humans, `.claude/rules/` for path-scoped coding conventions. A rule with a
mechanical check needs only its one-line statement here (CI carries the enforcement); a rule without one needs its full
statement here or in the rule file that owns its area, because nothing else will catch it.

## Where the details live

Each page below is the current-truth owner of its area, and most carry their own ADR trail. Read the page before working
in the area. **Do not cite ADRs from this file** — an ADR is frozen history (and may be `Proposed` or superseded, which
is invisible at the citation site), so reach it through the page that owns the topic.

## Path-scoped rules — `.claude/rules/`

Coding conventions live in `.claude/rules/*.md`, each carrying a `paths:` frontmatter glob. They are plain Markdown, not
a harness-specific format: an agent that supports path-scoped rules gets one loaded when a matching file is read, and
**every other agent must open the file itself**. Either way it arrives a beat late for code you are **creating** rather
than editing, so the entries below lead with what goes wrong unnoticed. Read the rule that owns an area before writing
new code in it.

- `services.md` — a new service takes **one `config: XxxServiceConfig` kwarg** (frozen, all deps inside); debug logging
  is the injected `DebugLogger`. Neither is checked.
- `python-conventions.md` — Protocol suffixes by shape, `do_<verb>` vs. `_<verb>_io`, docstrings stating the contract
  rather than the behavior, and when a subfolder is justified. **No mechanical check exists for any of it.**
- `adapters-domain.md` — adapters own I/O, domain is pure, aggregate mutations are verb-named after the event
  (`adopt_baseline`, not `update_baseline`). The field-assignment ban is checked; the naming is not.
- `romm-http.md` — an unproven 404 must never become `RommNotFoundError`, which is deletion authority downstream: the
  entity proof is the default and only the three byte-stream fetches opt out. Tests pin both directions; nothing else
  does. Also owns the transport's reachability state: a new request method sends through `_urlopen` (checked) and passes
  `romm_origin=False` if it does not talk to RomM (not checked).
- `bootstrap-wiring.md` — the `main.py` / `bootstrap/` split, and which half of `bootstrap/` new wiring belongs in.
- `callables.md` — the `{success, reason, message}` failure shape and its two carve-outs. Checked.
- `vendored-assets.md` — `_vendor/` and `native/` are checksum-pinned upstream copies — verbatim, or verbatim plus a
  documented local patch — and every vendored tree carries its own manifest. The checksums are checked; the reflex to
  fix the upstream artifact instead of the copy is not. `defaults/` holds no vendored artifact since the BIOS registry
  left.
- `testing-backend.md` — test tiers, gate tests, vendored conformance vectors.
- `testing-frontend.md` — the `@decky/api` event harness, non-vacuous catch assertions.
- `comments.md` — an inline comment is the exception: only an outside-world fact, a road not taken, or a constraint the
  code cannot express. Re-read the comment on the line you touch — a stale one is worse than none, because it is
  believed and nothing in the toolchain contradicts it. **No mechanical check exists.**

## Documentation

**Docs are updated in the same PR as the code change. This is not optional.** When a change affects architecture, data
flows, feature behavior, or user-facing UI, the relevant page under `docs/` must be updated in the same PR.
Documentation-debt-as-a-separate-follow-up-issue is forbidden — those follow-ups never land. If you're not sure whether
a change needs docs, the default is "yes, it does." Enforced in CI by `.github/workflows/docs-check.yml`.

For genuinely doc-irrelevant PRs (pure refactor with no user-visible change, no architecture shift, no new flow;
tooling/CI changes; dependency bumps), set the `no-docs-change` label on the PR OR include `docs: N/A` (with a one-line
reason) in the PR description. Opting out is an explicit acknowledgement, not a silent omission.

Docs are Material for MkDocs, published to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/docs.yml` on push to `main`. Preview
locally with `mise run docs`.

## Traps — non-obvious rules that bite silently

- **Shortcuts**: Use `SteamClient.Apps.AddShortcut()` from frontend JS, NOT VDF writes. VDF edits require Steam restart;
  SteamClient API is instant.
- **AddShortcut ignores most params**: `AddShortcut(name, exe, startDir, launchOptions)` ignores startDir and
  launchOptions. Must use `Set*` calls (`SetShortcutName`, `SetShortcutExe`, `SetShortcutStartDir`,
  `SetAppLaunchOptions`) once the new app's overview is registered. Do NOT pass quoted exe paths — the API quotes
  internally.
- **AddShortcut timing**: After `AddShortcut()`, wait for the new app's overview before setting properties — poll
  `appStore.GetAppOverviewByAppID(appId)` (`waitForAppOverview`), never a blind fixed delay. Use 50ms between operations
  in the apply loop.
- **Shortcut appId is assigned, not derived**: Steam assigns it at creation and it is stable for the shortcut's
  lifetime; the plugin records it in `roms.shortcut_app_id` and detects ownership by the exe path. Never re-derive it
  (the `CRC32(exe + appName)` formula is disproven). `launchOptions`/`startDir` changes are appId-safe; **exe/name**
  changes require delete + recreate.
- **Frontend API**: `@decky/ui` + `@decky/api` (NOT deprecated `decky-frontend-lib`). Use `callable()` (NOT
  `ServerAPI.callPluginMethod()`).
- **Decky callables must be async**: Even if the body is synchronous, Decky's callable framework requires `async def`.
  Do not remove `async` from callable methods in `main.py`.
- **RomM API quirks**: Filter param is `platform_ids` (plural). Cover URLs have unencoded spaces (must URL-encode).
  Paginated: `{"items": [...], "total": N}`. List calls page via `lib/romm_paging.py` and append
  `&with_char_index=false&with_filter_values=false` to skip aggregations the server otherwise computes on every request.
- **RomM minimum version**: Requires RomM >= 4.9.0, hard-rejected in `test_connection()` (`_MIN_REQUIRED_VERSION` in
  `main.py`) — the plugin is inert until the server is updated.
- **User-Agent on outgoing HTTP**: SteamGridDB **and** RomM behind Cloudflare Tunnel reject the default `Python-urllib`
  UA with 403. Every HTTP-talking adapter takes a `user_agent: str` ctor param; bootstrap threads
  `decky-romm-sync/<version>` from `package.json` — no hardcoded version strings.
- **Large payloads**: Never send bulk base64 through `decky.emit()` — the WebSocket bridge has size limits. Use per-item
  callables, and chunk bulk lists (the library apply emits shortcuts in batches; the metadata cache loads page-by-page).
- **No `BIsModOrShortcut` bypass**: the bypass counter was removed deliberately. Shortcuts return `true` (natural
  state); we own the game detail UI. Do not reintroduce a bypass.
- **`instanceof` against a DOM global is false in QAM code**: plugin code runs in the **SharedJSContext** window while
  the QAM panel's nodes belong to the QAM view's own document — two realms, confirmed live (the two documents do not
  share a URL, and neither can see the other's elements). What is **measured** is the `instanceof`: such a test is false
  for **every** node such code will ever see, so a guard written that way rejects everything and the feature is simply
  inert. Whether a constructor that takes the node as an argument — `new ResizeObserver(...)`,
  `new MutationObserver(...)` — also misbehaves across realms is **not** established here in either direction; those are
  named because taking the constructor from the node costs a property read, so the question need not be answered. Take
  the constructor from the node — `el.ownerDocument.defaultView` — as `WidePage` and `ScrollRegion` do. **The frontend
  suite cannot see this**: happy-dom has one realm, so the wrong global and the right one are the same object and every
  test passes.
- **A vendored package's stdlib assumptions are invisible to every check here**: nothing in this repo's toolchain runs
  Decky Loader's frozen Python, so vendoring or bumping anything under `_vendor/` is a device-test trigger, and what it
  risks is the plugin not loading at all rather than one feature misbehaving —
  [`.claude/rules/vendored-assets.md`](.claude/rules/vendored-assets.md).

## Current State

Latest release and shipped features: see `git tag --sort=-v:refname` and GitHub Releases. Roadmap and open work:
[GitHub Projects board](https://github.com/users/danielcopper/projects/2).

## Development

- **Build**: `pnpm build` (Rollup -> dist/index.js)
- **Tests**: backend — `python -m pytest tests/ -q` or `mise run test`; frontend — `mise run test:frontend` (Vitest +
  happy-dom)
- **Coverage**: backend — `python -m pytest tests/ -q --cov=py_modules --cov=main --cov-report=term --cov-branch`;
  frontend — `mise run test:frontend:coverage`
- **Lint**: `mise run lint` (import-linter, the `scripts/check_*` gates, markdownlint). Ruff and basedpyright run only
  inside `mise run gate`.
- **Gate**: `mise run gate` (the full CI battery in one command — mirrors every PR check; slow. Run before pushing.)
- **Setup**: `mise run setup` (installs JS + Python dependencies)
- **Dev reload**: `mise run dev [display]` (build + restart plugin_loader; a display like `dp4` / `internal` also opens
  windowed BPM on it after the deploy)
- **Frontend live dev**: `mise run dev:watch [display]` (one-time `mise run dev:setup`) — hot-reloads the **frontend**
  into windowed Big Picture on every save, no loader restart. **Backend** changes need `mise run dev:push-backend`. Lost
  the Decky UI after leaving BPM: `mise run dev:bpm-reset [display]`. Guide: `docs/contributing/frontend-dev-loop.md`
- **Tooling**: mise manages node, pnpm, python, uv; venv auto-creates at `.venv`. Python deps are pinned in
  `requirements-*.lock`, compiled from `requirements-*.txt` by `uv pip compile`; regenerate with `mise run lock-update`
  after editing a source or bumping a pin.
- **Pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`): formats staged files — `ruff format` + `ruff check` (Python),
  `prettier --write` (TS/TSX), `deno fmt` (Markdown). Stays fast (<2s); heavy validation is CI-only. Do not re-introduce
  heavy checks here.

## Code Quality

CI runs SonarCloud (Quality Gate: 80% coverage on new code, 0 bugs, 0 vulnerabilities), Ruff, basedpyright,
import-linter, pytest-cov branch coverage, and the repo's `scripts/check_*` gates. **The per-rule checks and what each
one enforces are listed in the invariant register below** — that table is the single inventory; do not duplicate it
here.

## Invariant register — cross-cutting safety rules

The audit's clearest pattern: every rule with a mechanical check held; every rule that lived in prose or in a reviewer's
head drifted. This register is the single inventory of the cross-cutting safety rules — the ones that span files, so no
diff-scoped review (human or agent) sees the whole rule — plus the current enforcement tier of each. It is a **map of
the enforcement surface, not the enforcement itself**: a `check`/`test` rule is enforced by the named artifact; a
`prompt-only` rule is not yet mechanized and is injected here so review carries it verbatim until a check exists. The
moment a `prompt-only` rule gets a mechanical check it moves to the `check` tier — a rule is never weakened to stay
green, and a real drift is a finding to triage, never an exemption. `[ours]`

Format: **invariant** — tier — enforced by.

- **Callable failures use `{success, reason, message}` (never `error` / `error_code`)** — check —
  `scripts/check_failure_shape.py --check`
- **A definitive 404 is `not_found`, never `server_unreachable` — a catch-all `except Exception` in `services/` may not
  bind a verdict key (`reason` / `status` / `recommended_action`) to a hardcoded `SERVER_UNREACHABLE`; route the
  exception through `classify_error`, or peel the 404 off with a sibling `except RommNotFoundError` where the verdict is
  a partial-success flag** — check — `scripts/check_404_not_unreachable.py --check`
- **A 404 becomes `RommNotFoundError` only when RomM's entity layer is proven to have answered it; only the three
  byte-stream fetches opt out** — test + prompt-only — `TestNotFoundDiscrimination` plus the per-call-site
  `test_generic_route_404_still_raises_not_found` trio in `tests/adapters/romm/test_http.py`; a fourth byte-stream
  fetch's opt-out is prompt-only — `.claude/rules/romm-http.md`
- **Every RomM request goes out through `RommHttpAdapter._urlopen`, the single point that clears the known-unreachable
  state — a request method calling `urllib.request.urlopen` itself leaves every retry ladder degraded to one attempt
  until an unrelated path happens to succeed, and nothing else fails** — check — `scripts/check_urlopen_choke_point.py`
  (structural, AST call sites — an alias or a `getattr` would slip past it. Which requests may skip the ladder, and
  which pass `romm_origin=False` because they do not talk to RomM at all, stays prompt-only in
  `.claude/rules/romm-http.md`)
- **Frontend↔backend callable parity (names + arity)** — check — `scripts/check_callable_manifest.py`
- **Every backend `emit` event name has a frontend listener, and vice versa** — check — `scripts/check_event_parity.py`
- **`settings.json` is written only by its owner (`adapters/persistence.py`)** — check —
  `scripts/check_settings_owner.py`
- **Sync run-lifecycle (`sync_state` / `current_sync_id`) written only via `LibrarySyncStateBox` verbs** — check —
  `scripts/check_sync_lifecycle_owner.py`
- **A library-sync seam is held only by the module owning the job it belongs to: `active_core` / `disc_resolver` by
  `services/library/shortcut_launch_resolver.py`, `renderer_rss` / `renderer_gc` by
  `services/library/session_budget.py`, and `artwork` by `services/library/cover_preparer.py` (the apply path's covers)
  **and** `services/library/reporter.py` (commit-time cover-path finalisation) — the one confinement with two owners,
  because those are two different questions a unit asks at two different points; two owners is a named pair, not a
  licence for a third, and the orchestrator that used to be the third holds no `ArtworkManager` at all. The `service.py`
  façade is not a co-owner — it may **pass** a seam on and may not **use** one, which the check reads structurally: a
  seam attribute standing as a call's keyword-argument value, and a seam annotation on a field of
  `LibraryServiceConfig`, are wiring; anything else in the façade is a finding** — check — `scripts/check_seam_owner.py`
  (AST over attributes named after a seam and over annotations naming its Protocol, resolved per seam rather than per
  module — owning one grants nothing about another. It sees the injection, not every later use: a seam aliased to a
  differently-named attribute or local, one reached through `getattr`, one passed positionally into a helper that holds
  it, a quoted string annotation, and a Protocol imported under an alias all slip past it — the last two only on the
  annotation half, because the constructor read that unpacks the config is flagged whatever the field is called). What
  the confinement buys is that each module's transactions stay separable: `shortcut_launch_resolver` holds a read UoW
  across its install-path scan while the `active_core` seam opens its own `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` per ROM, so folding the two
  into one pass deadlocks — on a real device only, since `FakeUnitOfWork` shares no connection. **Nothing mechanical
  stands behind that half.** `check_uow_seam_nesting.py` catches the fold only in its inline form (the seam method named
  inside the `with` block); the peer-call form — `do_build_core_overrides` invoked from inside the install-path readers'
  own UoW, which is what putting the three methods on one class makes cheapest — is that gate's documented blind spot
  and passes green. On the budget side the confinement holds `session_budget`'s stated promise that no renderer-RSS
  reading is taken anywhere else in the package
- **A module declared read-only calls no repository write — `services/library/local_library_reader.py` to start** —
  check — `scripts/check_read_only_module.py` (AST over the declared file's own calls, matching the two-attribute
  `<...>.<repo>.<method>` shape against the eleven repositories the UoW exposes). Read or write is decided **by the
  name's shape** — `get` / `get_*` / `iter_*` / `count` plus the explicitly listed reads — and
  `tests/scripts/test_check_read_only_module.py` re-derives every method name from `services/protocols/repositories.py`
  and pins its classification, so a new repository method fails there until it is classified. **The two directions are
  not symmetric.** A read named outside the shapes is called a write: loud, safe. A **write named like a read is called
  a read and passes in silence** — `uow.roms.get_or_create(...)` is green today, which is the very accident class this
  entry is otherwise about, so "repository writes are named as writes" stays a prose rule the gate does not carry. It
  also sees only calls the file itself makes, and only as calls: a write behind a helper it calls, a write **passed as a
  bound method** (`run_in_executor(None, uow.roms.save, rom)` — an attribute, not a call, and the exact idiom this
  module's own reads are invoked through), an aliased handle (`repo = uow.roms`), a `getattr`-reached repository, and a
  repository name not in its list all pass green. What it does catch is the plain `uow.roms.save(...)` dropped into a
  read module because a UoW was already open there. The declaration earns its keep by making the boundary checkable
  rather than descriptive: these reads open their own short UoW and are offloaded to an executor at points chosen for
  cheapness, so a write among them would land at a moment nobody picked. The platform stamp's DELETE stayed in
  `sync_orchestrator.py` on those grounds — it is a write, so a read-only module cannot hold it, and it is cohesive with
  the half of the apply pipeline that performs it: the DELETE stayed with `_sync_one_unit`, which builds a unit's delta,
  while the re-stamp went to `ChunkDispatcher._build_final_platform_stamp` with the final chunk whose commit UoW it
  rides, so the stamp's two ends now sit in two modules and each names the other. **Why the DELETE sits exactly where it
  sits in that pipeline is a property of its call site, not of its module** — after the fetch, after the artwork, after
  the cancel guard, before the first chunk (ADR-0023 / #1025) — and that argument lives in full at the call site's own
  comment, which is the only place a move could not have carried it away from
- **An emitted `sync_progress` frame stops a run (`running: False`) only with a terminal stage, and a terminal stage is
  only ever emitted with the run stopped** — test — `tests/services/library/test_terminal_frame_contract.py`
  (structural, AST call sites and dict literals across all of `py_modules/services` — it covers the error paths a
  behavioural test would have to provoke one at a time, but a frame assembled by a helper it cannot follow, or emitted
  through an aliased callable, slips past it; its own scope tests pin the producers and the root it reaches, so a
  narrowing fails rather than shrinking the rule in silence. Frame producers are not confined to `services/library/`:
  `services/artwork.py` emits through an injected `emit_progress`). The QAM panel derives "a run is in flight" from
  `running` and keys the run's end — the status line, the live-ETA teardown, the two change-driven re-reads — on the
  stage, so a stopping frame with a non-terminal stage would collapse the in-progress rows while ending nothing. The
  panel cannot defend against it: a bare `running: false` is exactly what its own retraction of an optimistic start
  looks like
- **A firmware answer nothing could establish is `unknown`, never `not_needed` — and the distinction survives every
  layer it crosses** — test + prompt-only — `tests/adapters/test_atlas_firmware.py` pins the adapter's degradation (a
  raising resolver, a missing installation, an answer with no root all come back with `resolved` clear, never as an
  empty catalogue reading "nothing needed"), `tests/domain/test_firmware_wants.py` pins the classification, and
  `tests/services/test_firmware.py::TestCheckPlatformBiosUnknown` pins the same listing answering `not_needed` under a
  whole reading and `unknown` under a partial one. The rule spans four modules and no diff-scoped review sees it whole:
  the adapter decides whether the reading happened, `domain/firmware_wants.py` holds the two values apart,
  `services/firmware/status.py` scopes the doubt to the emulators ES-DE offers for the platform, and both frontend
  surfaces render them as different sentences. **Nothing mechanical stands behind the scoping half.** A future caller
  that folds the two values back together — a truthiness test on a placement, a `wanted != "needed"` bucket, a default
  of `not_needed` where the catalogue is silent — goes green: the collapse is the upstream defect this swap removed, and
  it is one careless `or` away from returning. The scope is the second half, and there the two ends now agree rather
  than one trusting the other: `_core_scope` answers `None` both when the emulator catalogue could not be read **and**
  when it offers the platform no libretro core (35 of ES-DE's 172 systems, `ps3` among them — a mapped RomM platform
  whose only entry is RPCS3), and `reading_complete_for` refuses an empty scope as well as a `None` one. An empty scope
  read as complete is a finished reading of nobody: every server file classifies `not_needed`, `required_count` is 0,
  and the platform reports a green "Nothing required" over firmware the standalone emulator will not boot without
- **A firmware row the RomM library does not hold (`on_server: False`) counts towards readiness, and never towards a
  download affordance or a progress ratio** — test + prompt-only — `tests/services/test_firmware.py` pins the row's
  shape (`id` absent, `on_server` clear), that it raises `required_count`, and that it stays out of `server_count`;
  `src/components/library/PlatformsTab.test.tsx` pins that the buttons key off the fetchable set. **The three axes live
  in three places and nothing joins them.** `domain/bios_status.py::count_required` is readiness and counts every
  required row; `services/firmware/status.py::_bios_aggregates` scopes `server_count` / `local_count` to `on_server`
  rows; the download buttons' condition is a filter inside `src/components/library/PlatformDetail.tsx` and exists
  nowhere else — and since #1815 the per-row Download button reads the same filtered set, so a fourth reader of the axis
  now exists in that one file. A fifth reads it in the same file for the On-disk cell's second mark (`⊘`), and that one
  is display alone: it neither counts nor gates, which is what keeps it out of all three folds below. Each fold has its
  own quiet failure: drop the row from readiness and a platform reads ready while a required file is absent; add it to
  the ratio and a SNES page reports `0 / 26 files, 26 missing` for twenty-six optional files no core wants; add it to
  the buttons and the page offers a download that cannot succeed. `on_server` is the one field all three read; the row's
  `id: None` is an honest absence with no consumer at all, so nothing breaks if it is filled in and nothing is guarded
  by leaving it empty
- **No BIOS answer outlives the page that asked for it** — test + prompt-only —
  `tests/services/test_game_detail.py::TestGetCachedGameDetailCarriesNoBiosAnswer` and the two contract cases in
  `tests/contract/test_game_detail_read.py`. `get_cached_game_detail` carries none and says so (`bios_status_unknown`,
  plus an unconditional `bios` stale field); the live `get_bios_status` fills it in. What holds the rule is an absence —
  `BiosChecker` has one method, so there is no cheap cached twin to reach for — and an absence is exactly what a future
  change restores without noticing. Re-adding a stored answer would look like a performance win and would put a previous
  page open's requirement on this page
- **Aggregate state mutated only via verb-named methods (no field assignment)** — check —
  `scripts/check_aggregate_field_assignment.py`
- **No UoW-opening seam (ActiveCoreResolver, RelaunchOptionsResolver, uow_factory) is called while a UoW is open on the
  same path** — check — `scripts/check_uow_seam_nesting.py` (the first of the **two** rules that script carries, over
  one shared matcher; the file-I/O rule below is a different hazard with its own seam list and its own failure message,
  and neither entry is evidence about the other)
- **No file-I/O seam is called while a UoW is open — a Unit of Work wraps database reads and writes, never file or
  server I/O (CONTEXT.md → Unit of Work, ADR-0006)** — check — `scripts/check_uow_seam_nesting.py`, second seam family
  (`IO_SEAM_METHODS`). The list is **the seams this checker can see and has been told about, never an inventory of the
  I/O seams that exist**: `DiscResolver.enumerate_discs` / `.resolve_for_install` (a recursive walk of the ROM's install
  directory), the three `CoreInfoProvider` reads — `get_active_core`, `get_default_emulator`, `get_emulator_options` —
  which are answered by the vendored resolver's live read of ES-DE's catalogue (a system's first read opens it and the
  adapter's per-system cache is what a second one hits; `get_emulator_options` additionally globs each standalone
  option's emulator install through the find rules on **every** call, uncached so a component installed mid-session is
  seen), `SandboxLauncherFn` (re-probes the flatpak roots for `es_find_rules.xml` and re-stats it before it may use the
  parse cache), `SystemResolver` (parses the plugin's **own** bundled `config.json`, not RetroDECK's `retrodeck.json`,
  and does no network work despite living on the RomM HTTP adapter), `SystemSupportedExtensionsFn` / `SystemKnownFn`
  (two more questions to the same catalogue, through the same adapter cache), and `FirmwareFolderVerdictFn` (lists one
  core's declared folder and reads every candidate inside it the way the core does — 0.26 s for LRPS2 on the reference
  machine, the one seam here a cost was measured for). Two other real I/O seams were weighed and kept out — the reasons
  are in the script's docstring, and neither is an exemption; nor are those two an inventory of what else touches the
  disk. **"It's only a read" is the reasoning this rule exists to refuse**: `SqliteUnitOfWork.__enter__` issues
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, so even a read-only UoW takes the write lock. The database is in WAL, so readers are unaffected —
  but every other **writer** waits on the lock for up to `busy_timeout=5000` and fails with `SQLITE_BUSY` if it is still
  held then, and `FakeUnitOfWork` shares no connection, so no unit test notices. Six call sites had drifted across the
  rule before anything looked (#1779), for the reason the check exists: nothing at a call site reveals that an injected
  seam touches the disk. **The rule and the gate come from reading code — no measurement of how long any of those
  transactions actually held the lock exists, and nothing here should be read as one.** What the check sees is the
  deadlock rule's matcher unchanged — an **attribute** call naming a listed seam, lexically inside a
  `with <...>uow_factory()` block in the same function scope — so it inherits every blind spot of that half: a seam
  behind a helper one level down, an alias to a local, a factory attribute whose name does not end in `uow_factory`, a
  nested `def`/`lambda` (which resets the scope by design), a seam **passed as a bound method**
  (`run_in_executor(None, self._disc_resolver.enumerate_discs, install)` — an attribute, not a call, and
  `run_in_executor` is exactly how `disc.py` and `cores.py` reach their `_io` bodies; the same shape
  `check_read_only_module.py` records for its own gate), and the hand-maintained list itself, which cannot notice a seam
  whose implementation _grows_ a file read later. Matching only attribute calls is deliberate: the pure
  `domain.disc_selection.enumerate_discs` shares a name with the seam and does no I/O — it is safe because its call site
  imports it bare, not because of the name. The call-shaped blind spot is shared with the deadlock rule and only this
  family closes it: for its five `__call__`-only seams the list carries the attribute each is bound to
  (`_resolve_system`, `_sandbox_launcher`, `_system_extensions`, `_system_known`, `_firmware_folder_verdicts`) — by
  convention rather than by construction, and only while such a name means one thing, which is exactly what keeps
  `_list_files` out. Three of the five have no method name a consumer could write instead; `SystemResolver` and
  `SandboxLauncherFn` do, their implementations being `RommHttpAdapter.resolve_system` and
  `EsFindRulesAdapter.resolve_sandbox_launcher`, which is why `resolve_system` and `resolve_sandbox_launcher` are listed
  beside their attributes. The deadlock rule's own call-shaped seams stay open. `SystemResolver` is the odd one out for
  a second reason: the adapter memoises its map for the life of the process, so exactly one call ever opens the file,
  and the entry earns its place because that one call can land inside a UoW. One `# pragma: no uow-check` covers both
  families — it suppresses the line, and no seam is in both lists, so where a line does name two seams it silences both
- **Services never call clocks / sleep / uuid / random directly (inject the Protocol)** — check —
  `scripts/check_cosmic_call_bans.sh`
- **No module in `services/`, `bootstrap/`, `adapters/`, `domain/`, `lib/` or `models/` crosses the ~1000-LOC
  decomposition threshold, and the ones already over it may not grow** — check — `scripts/check_module_size.py` (the
  modules that predate the gate are grandfathered at their exact size. A ceiling goes up only for a change that adds no
  code — a rename, a reformat — and only with the reason recorded at its `ALLOWLIST` entry; a raise taken silently has
  retired the gate. Entries only ever come out, when the module drops back under the threshold. `main.py`, `_vendor/`,
  `tests/`, `scripts/` and `src/` are out of scope, each for a reason recorded at `SCOPE_DIRS`)
- **Service-independence contract list stays complete** — check — `scripts/check_service_independence_contract.py`
- **Layer import direction (services ↛ adapters, adapters ↛ services, …)** — check — `.importlinter` (`lint-imports`)
- **Frontend direction: `src/utils/` and `src/api/` never import `src/components/`, and no `src/` module takes part in
  an import cycle** — check — `eslint.config.js` (`import-x/no-restricted-paths`, `import-x/no-cycle`). These rules go
  inert rather than loud when misconfigured: `import-x/extensions` ships as `['.js']`, so until it names `.ts`/`.tsx`
  the plugin resolves an import but never opens the target to read its imports, and `no-cycle` reports nothing on any
  codebase. `src/eslintBoundaries.test.ts` lints known-bad fixtures through the real config and fails if any of the
  three stops reporting — a green `pnpm lint` alone proves nothing. Type-only imports are not edges (erased at runtime),
  which is why the `api/backend.ts` ⇄ `utils/cachedGameDetailStore.ts` back-reference is not a cycle
- **No bare `# type: ignore` / blanket suppressions** — check — `scripts/check_no_bare_ignores.sh`
- **Every pinned version in `requirements-*.lock` satisfies its `requirements-*.txt` source constraint** — check —

  `scripts/check_markdown_links.py`
- **Every stated RomM minimum version matches the enforced `Plugin._MIN_REQUIRED_VERSION`** — check —
  `scripts/check_romm_min_version.py` (ADRs excluded: frozen history)
- **Every tree under `py_modules/_vendor/` is pinned by the `<pkg>.SHA256SUMS` beside it: every manifest entry under
  `<pkg>/` matches the vendored file's digest, the vendored file set EQUALS the manifest's set restricted to that
  prefix, and a package directory with NO manifest is a failure** — check — `scripts/check_vendored_trees.py` (the
  manifest is discovered, never named in the script, so the next vendored package is guarded by default rather than when
  someone remembers — the hole this closed was a second tree, `vdf`, sitting unpinned beside a pinned `atlas` while the
  gate reported OK. The set-equality half is the part `sha256sum -c` cannot do at all: the plain form fails on a correct
  copy, because a wheel's manifest lists release artifacts and dist-info files we never vendor, and `--ignore-missing` —
  the flag that makes it green again — exits 0 after a vendored file is deleted). **What the check cannot see is the
  manifest itself.** For `atlas` it is upstream's own release manifest, so the digests additionally prove identity with
  the tagged release; for a patched copy like `vdf` it is our own digest of the tree we ship, so a manifest regenerated
  to bless a hand-edit passes green and only review catches it — which is why regenerating one is the last step of a
  deliberate re-copy and never the answer to a failing gate. The licence assertion is data-driven, not package-driven:
  the sibling `<pkg>.LICENSE` is checked exactly where the manifest carries a dist-info licence entry, and a sibling the
  manifest carries no entry for is reported as pinned by nothing — otherwise regenerating a wheel's manifest from its
  own tree would delete the licence check in the same step, silently, while the file stayed. Deliberately outside it:
  `py_modules/native/` is pinned by its own `sha256sum -c` over one `.so`, and `__pycache__` is ignored wherever it
  appears, on both sides of the comparison. **Two things are outside it by accident of shape, and neither is loud.** The
  gate sees **directories only** (`package_dirs` filters on `entry.is_dir()`), so a single-module dependency dropped in
  as `_vendor/six.py` is never asked for a manifest — and there is no shape here that could pin one: dropping a
  `six.SHA256SUMS` beside it makes the gate fail with "it pins no vendored tree", so the guarded-by-default half is a
  property of package DIRECTORIES alone. And `rglob` does not descend into a symlinked directory, so every file below
  one is invisible to the set comparison whatever the per-file symlink guard does; git records the link itself as mode
  120000, which is what makes it a review question rather than a silent one
- **Server-supplied path components pass `safe_join` (`lib/path_safety.py`)** — test + prompt-only — traversal tests per
  path builder; new call sites are prompt-only
- **A firmware row's presence comes from the resolver wherever the resolver declared it; the plugin's own filesystem
  probe covers only three leftovers** — prompt-only — `services/firmware/demand.py::FirmwareDemand.is_downloaded` is the
  single crossing point and states the boundary: the probe answers for a library file no core declares, for a placement
  whose location the plugin cannot honour, and for the already-there skip in the download batch. Everything else reads
  the resolver's `present`, which follows symlinks the plugin would have to re-implement — the PS2 folder is one
  directory reached through two spellings. `present is None` reads as absent, the safe direction, because the row then
  shows work outstanding rather than a readiness nobody established. **Nothing enforces the crossing point.** A fourth
  status builder calling `_firmware_file_store.exists(dest)` directly would go green, and its rows would silently answer
  from the weaker source — `os.path.exists` on a path the plugin assembled, which is what this cut removed after it
  rendered a satisfied requirement as missing. `services/firmware/status.py` holds that store itself, for
  `_stamp_deletable`'s records-still-on-disk probe, so the wrong probe is one line away from every row builder that
  should be asking `FirmwareDemand`. Related and separate: presence is not the row's verdict (CONTEXT.md → Row verdict),
  and a withheld verdict is not an absence — its cause is read off the row's caveat codes, never off the verdict itself
- **A firmware row's verdict is `BiosFileEntry.satisfied`, and for a folder declaration it is what the folder HOLDS —
  never that the folder is there** — test + prompt-only —
  `tests/services/test_firmware.py::TestAFolderRequirementIsAnsweredByItsContents` pins all three answers end-to-end,
  `tests/domain/test_firmware_wants.py` pins the two folds the service asks through, and
  `tests/adapters/test_atlas_firmware.py` pins which folder answers the unverified reading already settles and which
  codes those rows carry. The rule spans four modules and no diff-scoped review sees it whole: the adapter carries
  `declared_kind` and the folder verdict, `domain/bios_status.py::_row_verdict` decides the row's answer,
  `services/firmware/demand.py::FirmwareDemand.folder_answers` scopes the verified read, and both frontend surfaces
  colour and word the row off it. **Nothing mechanical joins those four**, which is what a consumer reading `downloaded`
  for a folder row breaks — an `if row.downloaded` beside the verdict, a count that spends presence as readiness.
  RetroDECK links LRPS2's `pcsx2/bios` onto the BIOS root, so such a consumer reports "All required ready" over a PS2
  install with no BIOS file at all; that was the state before #1807 declined the verdict, and this cut replaced the
  declining with a real answer, so the same field access brings it straight back. The same holds for the third value: a
  required row answered `None` takes the level to `unknown`, and folding it into `False` claims an absence nothing
  established. `declared_kind` carries a second rule with **no check at all**: a folder declaration is never offered as
  a download — the emulator lists that name, so there is no file to fetch into it. Three places refuse it today
  (`PlatformDetail.tsx`'s fetchable filter, `FirmwareDownloader._download_firmware_batch`, and
  `FirmwareDownloader.download_platform_firmware_file`, which answers one named file and so refuses with a reason where
  the batch simply passes the row over); `FirmwareDownloader.download_firmware(firmware_id)` still does not. It is the
  DECLARATION's kind, so it survives an absent folder, which is exactly the case a presence check would let through
- **The whole-machine firmware inventory is never asked with content verification** — prompt-only —
  `firmware_inventory()` is asked unverified and the verified question goes through `FirmwareFolderVerdictFn`, one core
  per call, only for the folder rows `unanswered_folder_cores` reports still open. `verify=True` on the inventory sweeps
  every unclaimed file under the BIOS root, plus each declared file the packaged identity table covers at a matching
  size; the plugin resolves the whole machine on every game-page open, so the flag would be a per-open cost over the
  user's entire BIOS directory. Nothing detects it — `firmware_inventory(verify=True)` is one keyword argument and every
  test stays green
- **No sentinel objects on the wire — explicit JSON-representable tagged values only** — prompt-only — no sentinel
  survives on the wire today (`NO_MIGRATION` retired with #1004, legacy `slot:null` confirmation with #1276), so the
  rule now guards reintroduction; nothing mechanical detects a new one
- **Every destructive op has backup-or-confirm; never delete data that exists nowhere else** — prompt-only — save-file
  removals route through the `.romm-backup` funnel (`MatrixExecutor.quarantine_local_file`; the removed-game cleanup's
  claimed variant is `PruneSaveSupport.quarantine_prune_saves`); every other delete path carries the rule unmechanized.
  Removed-game cleanup takes the **confirm** leg for one case deliberately: installed ROM content the user did not
  select for the recovery bundle is deleted with its row. The ROM is re-downloadable from RomM where a save is not, the
  per-candidate opt-in and its consequence are stated in the confirmation dialog and the user guide, and the row cannot
  be removed at all without a fresh 404 — so this is a disclosed choice, not an exception that drifted in. The adopt
  dialog's **replace** exit is the second such case, and it does **not** rest on that justification: the premise is that
  the content is the user's own — a different rip, a patch, a romhack — which is exactly what the server cannot hand
  back. What carries it instead is that the user is shown both sides, offered a content check, and chooses between two
  named outcomes behind a second confirmation ([ADR-0028](docs/adr/0028-adopted-install-is-an-install.md)). That
  reasoning covers the **ROM** only: an adoption's Overwrite also replaces save and savestate files, and those take the
  **backup** leg through the same `MatrixExecutor.quarantine_local_file` — every argument ADR-0028 gives for not
  quarantining a ROM (gigabytes, no sensible retention, re-fetchable from RomM) inverts for a save, and a savestate is
  synced nowhere at all. It is the first caller to hand that funnel a directory outside the saves root: it takes the
  directory it is given, so a savestate's backup lands in `<states>/.romm-backup/`
- **A BIOS file is deleted only where a `downloaded_bios` record names it under one of the platform's firmware slugs,
  and only at the path that record holds** — test + prompt-only —
  `tests/services/test_firmware.py::TestDeletePlatformBios` and `::TestDeleteOneBiosFile` pin every direction
  end-to-end: an emulator-shipped file survives, a hand-placed file under a server file's name survives, our own
  download is still removed once RomM no longer holds it, a download whose placement has since moved is unlinked where
  it was written rather than where the placement now points, and a per-row delete takes only the record it names. What
  makes the destructive-op rule (the `backup-or-confirm` entry) concrete for BIOS files is that authority to delete
  comes from having placed the file, and the record is the only evidence of that, because `BiosFile.mark_downloaded` is
  written in the download path and nowhere else. So the records are the delete's whole input: it iterates them, not a
  status listing, which is also what keeps a download RomM has since dropped deletable instead of gated behind a file
  list that no longer names it. The authorisations a reader reaches for instead are wrong in opposite directions.
  `downloaded` is `os.path.exists` and nothing more: authorise on it and Delete BIOS destroys firmware RetroDECK ships
  with its own components, which no RomM library holds and nothing here can fetch back — it did exactly that to
  `<bios>/dolphin-emu/Sys/codehandler.bin` on a real device. `on_server` describes what the library holds _now_, not who
  wrote the file: authorise on it and a file dropped from RomM after we downloaded it is stranded on disk with nothing
  in the UI able to remove it. The PATH has its own version of the same trap: a status row's `local_path` is recomputed
  from today's placement, so for a file fetched before an emu-atlas bump moved it the name still matches our record
  while the path names whatever now occupies the new destination — RetroDECK's own `codehandler.bin`, in the case that
  motivated this. The count the UI offers is bound to the same set: `deletable_count` on the `get_firmware_status`
  payload is records-still-on-disk, counted as distinct paths, because `local_count` is the library's progress ratio and
  is wrong in both directions — it hid the button entirely for a platform whose downloads had all left the library.
  **Since #1815 the same field is stamped per ROW** (`_stamp_deletable`), and the frontend authorises a destructive
  action on it: a row's Delete is offered where `deletable_count` is non-zero and nowhere else, and a folder row's
  counts the distinct files our records name underneath it, because a folder is never a download but what we put inside
  one is still ours — and two records naming one path are one unlink, the platform count's own rule read one layer in.
  That is a wire field a page reads to decide whether to offer a delete, so deriving it from `downloaded` — the same
  substitution as below, one layer out — puts the button on `codehandler.bin`; `TestGetFirmwareStatusDeletableCount`
  pins the row's answer for a file the plugin did not place. **Three buttons now reach one removal loop**
  (`PlatformBiosDeleter._delete_recorded_io`, under a record predicate per button): a second copy of that loop is the
  shape this rule is about, because the copies would drift silently. **Nothing mechanical stands behind any of this.** A
  delete path looping a status list on `downloaded` alone would go green — which is exactly the shape this one had when
  it destroyed that file
- **Every read-mutate-write of a `RomSaveSyncState` runs under `SyncEngine.rom_lock(rom_id)`** — prompt-only — sync
  paths, `get_save_status`, and the four slot mutations hold the lock; mechanize via a `rom_save_sync_states.save`
  call-site audit
- **Per-slot server reads/deletes go through `domain/save_slot.py` (legacy omits `&slot=`, client-filters)** —
  prompt-only — `get_slot_saves` / `get_slot_delete_info` / `delete_slot` / `list_file_versions` / `rollback_to_version`
  use `slot_query_param` + `save_in_slot`; RomM can't address `slot:null` via the param, so legacy MUST omit it + filter
  client-side, and a legacy delete is refused up-front
- **Every save-sync decision comes from `compute_sync_action` (via `list_saves`), never the `negotiate` op list; every
  automatic upload POSTs `overwrite=false` (409-backstopped); `overwrite=true` only from an explicit `keep_local`** —
  test + prompt-only — the hand-enumerated core cases (`tests/adapters/test_gavel_native_decision_table.py`) and the
  core property tier (`tests/adapters/test_gavel_native_property.py`) + contract 409 tests (`tests/contract/`); new
  upload/dispatch call sites are prompt-only
- **Both save-sync decisions run in the compiled gavel core, reached only through the `ComputeSyncActionFn` /
  `ResolveUploadConflictFn` seams; `domain/sync_action.py` holds only the `SyncAction` vocabulary the core answers in,
  so a change to either decision is a contract change carried by re-copied gavel vectors** — test — both vendored vector
  families run against the core (ladder in `tests/adapters/test_gavel_native.py`, decision table in
  `tests/adapters/test_gavel_native_table_vectors.py`); the `.so` and the vectors are pinned to the same upstream
  release tag and are bumped together
- **`applied_launch_options` is written only by the six recorded-state writer sites (sync ack-commit, download-complete,
  adopt-complete, uninstall, home-migration, version-switch), each recording the exact command the frontend wrote;
  excluded from the sync UPSERT; the only sanctioned reset is Force Full Sync's clear-to-NULL (a wrong recorded value is
  the only path to a wrong delta-skip)** — test + prompt-only — each writer site carries a value-exact test; new
  launch-options write paths are prompt-only — mechanize via a `set_applied_launch_options` /
  `record_applied_launch_options` call-site audit. Download-complete and adopt-complete are one site in the code
  (`RomInstallRecorder.do_record_applied_launch_options`) and two in the flow, because an adopted install is an install
  in every respect (ADR-0028)
- **An abandoned-chunk stash's whole-unit apply staging (`pending_sync` / `pending_all_roms` / `pending_cover_sources`)
  is never mutated while the stash is pending (box IDLE) — every run-entry path passes `try_begin_run`, which clears the
  stash before any staging write** — prompt-only — the invariant holds today rather than being aspirational; mechanize
  via a staging-writer call-site audit
- **An apply chunk's ack identity — `active_unit_id` / `active_chunk_index` and a fresh `unit_complete_event` — is
  stamped on the box BEFORE that chunk's `sync_apply_unit` is emitted, with nothing awaited in between** — test +
  prompt-only — `tests/services/library/test_chunk_dispatcher.py::TestAckIdentityPrecedesTheEmit`, which wraps
  `ChunkDispatcher._emit` and records the box at call time over a two-chunk unit. The rule spans three modules and no
  diff-scoped review sees it whole: `ChunkDispatcher` stamps, `services/library/_state.py` holds the fields and their
  verbs, and `SyncReporter.report_unit_results` validates an incoming ack against them (#1041). **What the test pins is
  the ordering inside the dispatcher, not the round-trip** — it observes a mock's call-time state, so a real frontend
  ack racing a real emit is still unexercised, and every other suite lets the emit mock swallow the call. The failure
  mode is why the entry exists rather than being left to the comment: stamp after the emit and a fast ack is rejected as
  stray, the wait then stalls the full 60-second heartbeat window, and the run ends by stashing a chunk the frontend had
  already applied — slow, plausible-looking, and silent (#1052 / #1367)
- **Every path on which the user answers the preview question leaves a live snapshot on neither side — the
  pending-preview store (`src/utils/pendingPreviewStore.ts`) and the backend's `pending_delta`** — prompt-only — three
  paths clear the store and tell the backend (`handleDismiss`, `handleApply`, a fresh `handleSync` press); the fourth is
  the cancel that lands just after a preview was staged, which never adopted it into the store and so discharges the
  rule by discarding server-side alone. Nothing mechanical can tell: an answer path is a `MainPage` handler, and neither
  the store nor the backend can know that a call it never received was an answer. Forget the store and a card stands
  over a decision already made; forget the backend and the terminal-stage re-ask fetches that card back a round trip
  later
- **A prune run's claim reservation and its refusal of every conflicting callable happen in one atomic gate hold (the
  preview rebuild does not), and frontend-owned Steam work holds a heartbeated, generation-tombstoned lease through
  every continuation's final write** — test + prompt-only — prune service/gate race tests + contract callable-entry
  matrix; new conflicting entry points are prompt-only
- **A prune frontend action mutates Steam only after atomically claiming its exact run/token/discriminant/binding;
  repeats are idempotent and an outcome lost in transit is ambiguous, never success** — test + prompt-only — prune
  service claim tests + `src/utils/pruneActions.test.ts`; new action kinds are prompt-only
- **Every installed-content mutation is authorized by a descriptor-relative no-follow claim (root identity, descendant
  identities, and — where a bundle exists — regular-file hashes) revalidated immediately before it, never by a path
  re-lookup; refusal, partial mutation and ambiguity are reported, never rewritten into success. The hashes bind a
  deletion to bytes held somewhere else, so they follow the **bundle**, not the caller: a source a sealed bundle holds
  consumes the bundle's digest-bound claim, a source it did not capture seals a fresh content-bound one, and a removal
  with no bundle anywhere — recovery off, or a user-initiated uninstall — seals identity-only
  (`claim_source(..., digest=False)`). An identity-only claim is also the only one that may adopt interrupted
  `.{basename}.romm-prune-*` staging, and only where a surviving install row proves the path. Everything else holds for
  both: staging rename, mount checks, no-follow traversal, and exact-identity revalidation under writer exclusion held
  across each unlink. The one guarantee that differs is all-or-nothing: a content-bound removal leases the whole tree up
  front, an identity-only directory leases per unlink (a whole-tree hold hits `EMFILE` and makes large dumps
  un-uninstallable), so a writer arriving mid-loop yields a reported partial removal instead of a clean refusal** —
  test + prompt-only — descriptor-path, recovery-adapter, real RomRemovalService, and prune contract tests; new mutation
  adapters are prompt-only
- **Every prune frame carries its originating preview ID; only a matching pending preview may adopt a run, and an
  accepted contiguous terminal result seals it against every later frame** — test + prompt-only — prune service frame
  tests + `src/utils/pruneStore.test.ts`; new prune frame types are prompt-only
- **Every destructive RomM proof is bound to one canonical server-origin/token-origin/user namespace from preview
  through every exact-ID request; a namespace change is uncertainty, never a 404 deletion authority** — test +
  prompt-only — prune service namespace-race tests; new destructive RomM proof paths are prompt-only
- **Every write into per-rom detail state that crosses an `await` is bound to a rom identity — the store
  (`src/utils/gameDetailStore.ts`) via `writerForRom`, or the answer's own `rom_id` in `applySaveStatus`; the panel's
  state, event and tab-content modules (`src/components/panelState.ts`, `src/components/panelEvents.ts`,
  `src/components/panelTabContent.tsx` — the panel component itself holds none of these writes) via `RomBinding`, built
  by `bindRom` for a read a run of the `[appId]` effect issued and by `bindRomInState` for the active tab's panes, whose
  writer is built during render; the achievements tab (`src/components/AchievementsTab.tsx`) by construction, its React
  key being the rom id, so its state cannot outlive the identity it was read for. A version switch re-keys without
  closing, so neither the store's generation counter nor the panel's `[appId]` effect sees this class. Binding answers
  the wrong-rom question only; two answers for the SAME rom are ordered instead, by a sequence taken when the read is
  issued — the store's `loadSeq`, the panel's `takeReadTicket` (#1717). Four writes are unbound: the two identity writes
  install what a binding would compare against, so ordering is all they can have, and both have it. The other two have
  neither — the store's `cached.bios_status` fold runs in the same synchronous run as its guard, and the event lane's
  `handleBiosChange` answers for the platform's default core and can overwrite a rom-keyed answer (#1718). The panel's
  remaining lazy lane writes through the raw setter, ordered by the same ticket. The play button is NOT covered
  (#1714)** — test + prompt-only — the panel's thirteen bound sites each carry a version-switch test
  (`src/components/RomMGameInfoPanel.test.tsx`); the store side and every new write site on either are prompt-only,
  because a checker scoped to the store's own function bodies would be green on the case this rule was written for. The
  reasons behind the two writer mechanisms live at `writerForRom` and `RomBinding` — do not restate them here
- **Every row a reader must be able to reach on a wide QAM page is a row Steam can focus — a toggle, a button, or a
  `Focusable` carrying an activate handler, including a table row with no action of its own, so the reader can walk the
  table** — prompt-only — nothing checks it, and the frontend suite cannot see it: happy-dom has no nav tree, so a page
  whose rows are unreachable renders exactly like one whose rows are not, and a mouse-driven dev loop never meets the
  problem either. A region scrolls only by moving focus — Steam's plain `ScrollPanel` binds no gamepad direction — so an
  unreachable row is also an unscrollable one, and everything below the fold is simply out of reach with a controller.
  The trap is that a bare `Focusable` is a container rather than a focus stop: the base panel sets `focusable` only from
  a caller prop or an `onActivate`/`onOKButton`, and `GetFocusable()` answers `"none"` for a node with neither and no
  focusable children. The rule spans every page the wide frame will host, and the frame cannot carry it: it holds a
  page's content as opaque nodes, never as rows it could check. **What the frame DOES carry is the content outside a
  region's focusable rows, at both ends** — a heading, a counts line or a column header above the first, a legend or a
  total below the last, each unreachable for the same reason and with no neighbour to ride along with — so
  `ScrollRegion` scrolls itself to the top when focus reaches the first stop in it and to its end when focus reaches the
  last (`revealEdge`, over `revealTop` and `revealBottom`). Both halves are pinned by
  `src/components/qam/ScrollRegion.test.tsx` over mocked geometry, so what is tested is the DECISION and not the scroll:
  whether the panel and the reader agree about which element is topmost or last stays device-only, like the rest of this
  entry. Detail: `docs/architecture/qam-panel.md`, "Building blocks"

When a change applies a guard / sanitize / backup / grouping pattern, sweep for sibling sites of the same pattern — the
register is what that sweep checks against.

## Security

- NEVER read or use credentials from settings files (`~/homebrew/settings/`) without explicit user permission
- NEVER pass credentials to agents — if API calls are needed, ask the user to run them and provide output
- NEVER log secrets (passwords, API keys) — mask them in any log output

## Working Style

- **Research before implementing.** When encountering an unknown (how a third-party tool works, where files are stored,
  what APIs exist), STOP and research first. Present findings and agree on an approach before implementation.
- **Discuss architecture decisions.** This is not a vibe coding project. Non-trivial changes require discussion before
  code is written. When you find a problem, explain it and propose options — don't just start fixing.
- **Use agents** for everything beyond trivial single-file edits — research, exploration, implementation. Keep main
  context on architecture and coordination.
- **Sequential agent discipline.** Each agent's prompt MUST include: "When done, report back and wait for shutdown. Do
  NOT pick up other tasks from the task list."
- **Preserve context.** Get alignment first, then implement cleanly in one pass.
- **Sub-issue policy**: epic bodies do **not** carry markdown sub-issue lists — open work is tracked via GitHub's native
  Sub-Issues panel. Link new sub-issues natively; don't add body bullets.
