# CONTEXT.md — decky-romm-sync domain glossary

This file is a glossary. It defines the canonical meaning of project-specific terms so that conversations, issues, PRs,
and code stay aligned. It is _not_ a spec or design doc — implementation docs live in `docs/architecture/`, and
architectural decisions live in `docs/adr/`.

When a term resolves during a discussion, it gets added here. When a term's meaning changes, the entry gets rewritten —
not appended to.

## Terms

### Aggregate

A cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit for data consistency. Per Cosmic Python chapters 1–7:

- Has **one root** entity (a dataclass) that is the only external entry point.
- Enforces all of its own **invariants** — outside code cannot violate them.
- Is the **transaction boundary**: saved atomically as a unit.
- Has exactly one **identity**. Other aggregates reference it by ID only, never by holding a Python reference to its
  internals.
- Mutation is **only via methods on the root**, named after the domain event that occurred (`adopt_baseline(...)`,
  `confirm_slot(...)`, `mark_installed(...)`). Direct field assignment from services is forbidden.
- Has exactly **one Repository** Protocol. The Repository's job is "give me this aggregate by ID, save this aggregate" —
  it may touch multiple tables under the hood.

What an aggregate is _not_: a DTO sent to the frontend, a query projection, or "stuff that happens to live in the same
file." Aggregate boundaries are **invariant boundaries**, not storage boundaries.

Chapters 8+ of the CP book (domain events + message bus) are explicitly out of scope. Triggers for revisiting that scope
are documented in `CLAUDE.md`. The concrete aggregate set, its tables, and the enforcement layers live in
`docs/architecture/database-design.md` — this entry defines the term, not the inventory.

### Value Object

An immutable member of an aggregate, built whole and never mutated in place — a `@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)`,
not a `@cosmic_aggregate` root. It has no identity of its own and no mutation surface to police, so it carries neither
the decorator nor the verb-method discipline an aggregate root does. `FileSyncState` (inside `RomSaveSyncState`) is the
canonical example. The foil to **Aggregate**: a root has identity and methods; a value object has neither.

### Repository

The single persistence seam for one **Aggregate** — "give me this aggregate by id, save this aggregate." Exactly one
Repository per aggregate root (Protocol in `services/protocols/`, SQLite adapter behind it). It may touch several tables
to reconstruct or persist the aggregate — the `RomSaveSyncState` repository spans `rom_save_sync_states` +
`rom_save_files` — but callers see only `get(id)` / `save(id, aggregate)`. It _is_ the load/save layer; the service
layer never wraps it in a second one (no `StateService`-style holder between service and repository). Reached only
through the **Unit of Work** (`uow.rom_save_sync_states`, `uow.rom_installs`, …), never constructed directly.

### Unit of Work

The atomic transaction boundary one operation works inside, and the carrier of the **Repositories** for that
transaction. Owned by the service layer at the operation's entry (never by `main.py` callables); a `with uow:` block
opens one connection, exposes the repositories, and commits on clean exit / rolls back on exception (stdlib `sqlite3` +
`run_in_executor`, per [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-sync-sqlite-unit-of-work.md)). Kept **narrow** — it wraps only the
database reads/writes, never network/file I/O or a frontend round-trip; cross-operation consistency comes from the
operation's own serialization (the per-ROM save lock, the single library-sync task), not from holding a UoW open.

### Persistence boundary (settings.json / SQLite)

Where a piece of persisted state lives is a deliberate decision driven by what the data _is_, not which file it
historically lived in. Per [ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-json-sqlite-persistence-boundary.md), three buckets, and the bucket
picks the store:

1. **User-intent config** — flat, no relationships, the user sets it → **`settings.json`**. Includes credentials, scalar
   toggles, the sync-selection lists (`enabled_platforms`, `enabled_collections`), the save-sync feature toggles
   (`save_sync_enabled`, `sync_before_launch`, `sync_after_exit`, `default_slot`, `autocleanup_limit`), and
   `device_name`.
2. **Observed / derived-from-an-external-source** — read, not set → **read live by default**; persisted (in `kv_config`)
   only as a last-seen marker for cross-run change detection. The RetroDECK home path and save-sort settings markers
   live here.
3. **Synced / derived relational state with real invariants** — per-ROM groups, history, caches of remote data →
   **SQLite aggregates**.

`device_id` now lives in the `kv_config` table; bucket-3 save state lives in SQLite aggregates. `save_sync_state.json`
is a dead store — never written, read exactly once at bootstrap for the one-time legacy settings fold. As of #822 it no
longer held the save-sync toggles or `device_name` (those moved to `settings.json`, settings schema v4).

### Cutover

The hard cut from JSON state files to SQLite ([#784](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/784)) has
landed. "Hard" means **SQLite started empty** — the JSON state was not migrated into it, and the JSON-era domain classes
(`SaveSyncState`, `PluginState`) and `domain/save_state.py` were deleted in the same wave. Bucket-1 config
(`settings.json`) and the change-detection markers were unaffected; only the relational save/library/playtime state was
re-derived from scratch (re-synced from RomM, re-pruned against disk).

### kv_config

A key-value table for small singleton configuration values that don't justify their own aggregate or table. One row per
key.

Residents (per [ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-json-sqlite-persistence-boundary.md)): the RetroDECK home path marker
(`retrodeck_home_path` + its pending-migration `_previous`), the save-sort settings markers (`save_sort_settings` +
`_previous`), `device_id` (server-issued identity), and `platform_names` (platform_slug → display_name cache). The
schema version is **not** a `kv_config` key — it lives in `PRAGMA user_version`.

**Not** a dumping ground: anything with its own lifecycle, invariants, or repeat-row potential gets its own aggregate.
`kv_config` is for the truly small, the truly singleton, and the truly miscellaneous.

### Rom (aggregate) vs ROM (file) vs RomM (server)

Three things spell similarly; distinct meanings:

- **Rom** — the aggregate / domain entity owned by this plugin (`domain/rom.py`). Represents one ROM as the plugin
  tracks it locally: identity, the denormalized `platform_slug`, sync metadata, the Steam shortcut binding.
- **ROM** (or "ROM file") — the actual playable game file on disk (e.g. `.iso`, `.cue`, `.gba`). What `RomInstall`
  records once a `Rom` has been downloaded.
- **RomM** — the upstream self-hosted server. The source of truth this plugin syncs _from_.

Convention: always write `Rom` (PascalCase) when referring to the aggregate. Write "ROM file" when referring to the
on-disk artifact.

### Version (RomM: sibling) vs Region / Languages

A **version** is one concrete released dump of a game — its own RomM `rom_id`, its own file, its own save universe
(saves never carry across versions; matches RomM's per-ROM saves and RetroArch's per-content save naming). All versions
of one game form a **sibling group** (RomM's `sibling_roms`: same matched metadata id, per platform; unmatched ROMs are
solo groups). Key derivation: `domain/sibling_group.py`, persisted as `roms.sibling_group_key`
([ADR-0021](docs/adr/0021-sibling-group-one-shortcut-binding-active-version.md)).

- **Active version** — the sibling currently bound to the group's Steam shortcut (`roms.shortcut_app_id`); the one that
  installs, launches, and syncs saves. Binding = active version (ADR-0021).
- **Default version** — RomM's per-user `is_main_sibling` ("SET DEFAULT" in RomM's Switch-version UI). Optional;
  respected read-only as a preselect, never written back.
- **Switch version** — the user-facing control (named after RomM's) that changes the active version within a group;
  rendered only when the group has more than one version (#1297/#1298).
- **Reachable** — a version a reader can get to from Steam: any member of a group that holds a binding, since the
  group's one shortcut opens the game's page and **Switch version** reaches the rest from there. Distinct from
  **bound**, which is the active version alone. A count of reachable ROMs is what a surface states about how much of a
  platform arrived in Steam; a count of bindings is what it states about shortcuts, and the two are only equal where
  every group **that holds a binding** is a single version — a group with no binding raises neither count
  (`reachable_count` vs. `count`, `services/library/reporter.py`).

**Region** and **Languages** are **attributes of a single version**, parsed from its filename tags: `(Spain)` → where
that release shipped; `(En,Fr,De,Es)` → the languages contained in that one dump. A multi-language version is still one
version. UI rule: Region/Languages render on the game-detail page for the active version only — they are never a version
list and never the switch mechanism.

### file_path vs rom_dir (RomInstall paths)

The two path fields on `RomInstall` (`domain/rom_install.py`) answer different questions and must not be conflated:

- **`file_path`** — the **launch file**: the single file that is the ROM's launch identity. Present for every ROM;
  save-path resolution, ES-DE core resolution, and the displayed filename all derive from it. It is the **default**
  launch target baked into the Steam shortcut's `launch_options` (`flatpak run … "<file_path>"`, run by the
  `rom-launcher` exec wrapper per [ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-launcher-pure-exec-wrapper-baked-launch-options.md), which
  superseded the dynamic SQLite read of [ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-launcher-resolves-path-from-sqlite.md)) — but the baked
  launch **target** may be **overridden at bake time** without rewriting `file_path`: a multi-disc pin bakes the
  selected disc's path
  ([ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-per-game-disc-selection-in-db-applied-as-bake-time-launch-path-override.md)), and a
  folder-boot system (PS3/RPCS3) bakes the game **directory** rather than the nested launch file
  ([ADR-0019](docs/adr/0019-folder-as-launch-target.md)). `file_path` stays the launch **file** anchor in every case.
- **`rom_dir`** — the **dedicated per-ROM directory**, present only for folder-backed (multi-file) ROMs. **NULL for
  single-file ROMs**, which live as a bare file directly in the shared `<roms>/<system>/` directory and own no dedicated
  folder.

Single-file vs multi-file is **read from `rom_dir` presence** — never re-derived from the file's parent directory, never
stored as a separate boolean ([ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-rom-install-launch-file-and-rom-dir.md)). Migration moves
`rom_dir` whole when set, else the file; uninstall removes `rom_dir` whole when set, else the file. A future per-file
`RomFile[]` model — one row per physical file, each tagged with a RomM `category` (`game` / `dlc` / `update` / `mod` /
…) — is the planned shape for the multi-file features in
[#140](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/140) /
[#129](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/129); it is an additive 1:N child of `rom_installs`
(deferred until those land), and `file_path` + `rom_dir` are its forward-compatible projection.

### Launchable install / no launch target

A downloaded ROM whose recorded **launch file** is something the system cannot act on — a PS3 `.pkg` installer (the game
is still sealed inside the package), a bare disc track `.bin`. `detect_launch_file` ends in "largest file by size", so a
download none of its format rules recognise still yields a `file_path`; `RomInstall.launchable` records whether that
path is a real launch target, decided once at download-complete against the system's live ES-DE accept-list
([#1652](https://github.com/danielcopper/decky-romm-sync/issues/1652)).

"No launch target" is a statement about the **launch command**, never about the download. The files stay on disk, the
install row is written, and uninstall works normally — installing the package by hand in the emulator is the documented
RetroDECK procedure and a refusal that discarded the download would leave the user worse off. What is withheld is the
baked `launch_options`: an unlaunchable install resolves to the empty path in the `DiscLaunchResolver` seam, so every
bake site emits the same empty launch command an **un-downloaded** ROM's shortcut carries.

Unlaunchable is always a **proven** verdict, never the absence of one: an unreadable accept-list, an unknown system, and
a pre-migration row all read as launchable. The foil is a **folder-boot** install, whose `file_path` extension is
irrelevant because the baked target is the game directory.

### Adopt

To take something already present into the plugin's records without having produced it. The object varies — a local save
file becomes a tracked baseline (`adopt_baseline(...)`), a play session survives a frontend reload, an identity-only
claim picks up the debris of an interrupted removal
([ADR-0027](docs/adr/0027-claim-discipline-follows-the-recovery-bundle.md)), a ROM already on disk becomes an install —
but the rule does not: the recorded state derives from what was found, not from what the plugin did. _Avoid_: claim
(reserved for the removal machinery's authorization), import, link, register.

### Adopted install

A `rom_installs` row for content the plugin did not download. Indistinguishable from a downloaded one in every respect,
**including deletion authority**: uninstall and removed-game cleanup delete an adopted ROM's files exactly as they would
a downloaded ROM's. The protection therefore sits at the moment of adoption — proving the content is the ROM the row
will claim — never in a downstream exemption, because a second class of install row would need a second branch in every
consumer (uninstall, cleanup, home migration, version switch).

### Adoption candidate

An entry at the top level of the platform's ROM directory that no `rom_installs` row accounts for, whose shape matches
what the server serves, and whose **normalized name** equals the ROM's. "Candidate" carries the uncertainty
deliberately: a name says nothing about content, so until it is verified this is a guess — and what ranks one candidate
above another is only cheap evidence (a single-member archive's CRC32 from the ZIP index, an exact size), never proof.
The verification (CRC32/MD5, read from a ZIP's central directory where the content is archived) is always
user-triggered, never a wait imposed before the plugin will say anything.

### Entry kind

What an entry on disk **is**, judged by its own type without following it: `file`, `dir` or `link`. There is no fourth
value — anything else a filesystem can hold (a FIFO, a socket, a device node) gets no kind at all, because "file or
directory" has no truthful answer for one and inventing one is what let a named pipe be offered as a game. One rule
answers this for every read of the filesystem, and the two kinds of read differ only in what they do with a kindless
entry: a **directory listing** leaves it out, while **describing one named path** reports it with the kind absent —
something that is there must never come back as nothing, or the next write goes over it in silence. A `link` is its own
kind rather than whatever it resolves to: an install row must be removable, the uninstall path refuses a symlink, so a
link is never adoptable however well its target resolves. _Avoid_: "shape" for this — **shape** is the
single-file-vs-folder question the server answers, and the two are different judgements about different things.

### Unusable namesake

An entry whose **normalized name** equals the ROM's but which cannot become its install: the other **shape** — a
directory where RomM serves a single file, or a loose file where it serves a folder — or any `link`. It is deliberately
**not** an adoption candidate: nothing about it can be taken over, so it is never offered, ranked or renamed. It is
still reported, because the alternative is a download that silently produces a second copy of the game beside it. The
dialog's two exits are download-anyway (the server's copy lands beside it, under the server's name) and cancel; neither
touches the entry. The two reasons are not one reason: a wrong shape is wrong only against what the server sends, so
that refusal names the served shape, while a `link` is unusable on its own terms and naming a shape beside it would
suggest the other shape would have taken it. _Avoid_: mismatched candidate, unusable candidate — the whole point is that
it is not one.

### Normalized name

A ROM filename reduced to the game it denotes: extension removed, bracketed groups `(...)` / `[...]` dropped with their
contents, every run of non-alphanumerics collapsed to one space, lowercased, trimmed.
`Example Quest - Second Journey (Rev 1) (USA).zip` → `example quest second journey`. It is the candidate search's only
match key, applied identically to both sides. An empty normalization (a name that is nothing but tags) matches nothing
rather than everything. _Avoid_: fuzzy match, similar name — the comparison is exact equality of the normalized strings,
and no edit distance or token scoring is involved.

### platform_slug (denormalized)

The RomM platform identifier (e.g. `gba`, `psx`) carried as a plain string on the rows that need it (`roms`,
`rom_installs`, `downloaded_bios`, `firmware_cache`). There is **no local `Platform` aggregate** — that was proposed in
ADR-0001 and **dropped by [ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-json-sqlite-persistence-boundary.md)** on YAGNI grounds. Platform
display names resolve live from RomM; sync exclusion is the user-intent `enabled_platforms` config in `settings.json`,
not per-platform local state. A `Platform` aggregate is reintroduced only when a concrete need lands (the
standalone-emulator roadmap), not speculatively.

### Emulator override vs default core vs active core

Three distinct notions in core selection, kept separate because they have different owners and lifetimes:

- **Default core** — the emulator RetroDECK declares for a platform (in `es_systems.xml`) — see **default emulator** for
  the precise selection rule, which may resolve to a RetroArch core **or** a standalone emulator. RetroDECK-owned; it
  can change on a RetroDECK update. The plugin reads it live and **never stores** it — a stored copy would go stale.
- **Emulator override** — a deliberate user choice to deviate from the default core, at **per-game** or **per-platform**
  scope. The plugin owns the override and stores **only the deviation**; the absence of an override means "follow the
  default." A core the user picks inside ES-DE's own UI is _not_ an emulator override in this sense — it is ES-DE's
  state, which the plugin does not own.
- **Active core** — the core a ROM actually launches with: the override when one exists, the default otherwise. One
  resolver answers it for both the launch and every read consumer (BIOS requirement, save path, game-detail badge), so
  the launched core never diverges from what those reads assume.

### Wanted (firmware): needed / optional / not needed / unknown

What the machine says about one firmware file on a platform's list. The first two are the resolver's per-file answer —
an installed emulator will not run without it (**needed**), or can use it and will run without it (**optional**). The
last two are not properties of the file at all but of the **reading**: every libretro core the platform offers stated
what it wants and none named this file (**not needed**), versus the reading was not complete (**unknown**) — one of
those cores could not be asked, or the platform offers no libretro core to ask at all, standalone emulators being
outside the scope.

Keeping the last two apart is the whole point of the vocabulary — "nothing wants this" is a finished answer and "nothing
could be established" is the absence of one, and a single boolean called both _not required_. **Wanted** is a property
of the machine and does not move with the core the user picked; the launch-scoped question is **required by active
core**, which is what the missing-BIOS badge counts. The foil to **BIOS level** (the platform-wide readiness verdict:
unknown / ok / partial / missing).

A wanted file need not be one the RomM library holds — the two sets overlap without either containing the other, and a
platform's list is their **union**. A row the library does not hold is marked **not on server**: it counts towards
readiness, because it is a real prerequisite that is really absent, and never towards a download or a progress ratio,
because nothing in the plugin can fetch it.

### Row verdict (firmware): met / unmet / withheld

Whether one row's requirement is met, and the axis the **readiness** counts key off. It is **not** whether something is
at the destination: for a **folder declaration** the two come apart completely, since what satisfies the core is a file
_inside_ the folder and RetroDECK links LRPS2's `pcsx2/bios` onto the BIOS root, so the folder is there on every
install. Every statement below is scoped to a **required by active core** row first — a row the launching core does not
require moves no count whatever its verdict — and the library's own held/offered ratio is a third axis again, counting
what the RomM library holds rather than what is met.

- **met** — raises `required_downloaded`. For a declared folder, the resolver listed it and an image inside passes the
  core's own content check. For a declared file it is presence at the destination, answered by the resolver wherever it
  placed the file under the BIOS root and by the plugin's own probe for the rest — a library file no core declares, and
  a file an emulator keeps in its own tree.
- **unmet** — counted as a file shown to be absent, so it reads red and raises the play row's **BIOS badge**. A folder
  the resolver listed and found no image in is exactly this, and so is one that is not there at all.
- **withheld** — the reading established neither. It raises neither count, and while a required row carries one the
  **BIOS level** declines to `unknown` rather than claiming either. The rows below keep their own answers; only the
  one-line verdict declines.

The CAUSE of a withheld verdict is read off the resolver's **caveat codes** carried on the row — a folder read that
could not finish, a candidate the identity table and the core's own header check disagree about, a directory obstructing
a destination the emulator opens as a file — because the verdict is deliberately the answer alone and carries none of
it. What the verdict does decide is which family of codes can apply, and what a surface says when none of them is
recognised.

Not every unestablished thing is withheld here. A declared file whose _bytes_ were never verified is not — and for
almost every such file the reason is simply that nobody asked: the verified question is put to one core at a time and
only where a folder row is open, so on a platform whose cores declare no folder nothing is verified at all. Where it
_is_ asked, it verifies that core's declared files too — each one the packaged identity table covers at a matching size,
and no others — and their **verdicts** are dropped unread. Either way, reading an unasked content question as a withheld
verdict would decline readiness for every row on every platform. The foil to **not on server**, which is a settled
absence and does count towards readiness.

### Safely-bakeable

An ES-DE `<command>` the plugin can bake into a Steam shortcut's `-e` override: a real emulator invocation that **ends
in `%ROM%`** and carries none of the forms the bake can't carry — no `%INJECT%` sidecar (that is _needs-setup_, not
launchable from Steam until ES-DE has run it once), no `%ENABLESHORTCUTS%` / `%EMULATOR_OS-SHELL%` shortcut-script form,
no embedded quoting (`"` or `\;`), no `%STARTDIR%` (RetroDECK's `run_game.sh` parses-but-drops it), and no placeholder
outside the known whitelist. The classifier `domain/emulator_commands.py` decides this per command; anything not
safely-bakeable is surfaced in the picker as **disabled** with a reason, never silently offered
([ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-live-es-systems-emulator-resolution.md)). The foil to **default emulator** (the first
safely-bakeable command a system falls back to).

### Default emulator

The emulator a ROM launches with absent any per-game or per-platform **emulator override**: the **first
_safely-bakeable_ command in a system's `es_systems.xml` document order**. ES-DE lists a system's emulators in
preference order, so ES-DE's own preference picks it — the plugin adds no curation. It may be a **RetroArch core** or a
**standalone emulator** (PCSX2, RPCS3, Dolphin, …), whichever ES-DE lists first that the plugin can bake. Resolved live
from the sole source (`es_systems.xml`) — there is no bundled snapshot (the curated `core_defaults.json` was deleted in
\#1210). **Document order** here is the order the file DECLARES, never the order ES-DE would run: a gamelist
`<altemulator>` / `<alternativeEmulator>` promotes an entry for ES-DE and moves nothing here
([ADR-0030](docs/adr/0030-the-emulator-catalogue-is-read-by-the-vendored-resolver.md)). When no command is
safely-bakeable (or the catalogue can't be read) there is no default emulator and the ROM plain-launches, letting
RetroDECK resolve its own command ([ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-live-es-systems-emulator-resolution.md)). The foil to
**emulator override** (a user deviation from this default).

### Disc

The launchable unit of a multi-disc ROM: a single-disc **container** file the emulator opens directly — a `.cue`, a
`.chd`, or an `.iso` (`DISC_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`, `domain/disc_formats.py`). A disc is **not** its `.bin` sidecar (raw
track data a `.cue` references, never launched directly) and **not** the `.m3u` playlist (which points at several
discs). When a bin/cue PS1 game ships both files, the disc is the `.cue`, never the `.bin`. The foil to **disc-image
format** (the file-shape category) and **selected disc** (the user's per-game pick among the discs).

### Disc-image format

The format-semantic, emulator-independent category "this file shape is a launchable disc image" — the hardcoded set
`{.cue, .chd, .iso}` (`DISC_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`). It answers _is this a disc image?_, which es_systems cannot: es_systems
is a flat per-system accept-list with no per-token role metadata, so it can say a system _accepts_ `.cue` but never that
`.cue` is a disc while `.bin` is its sidecar. The set is intersected with the system's **live** es_systems accept-list
at enumeration time, so the hardcoded knowledge supplies disc _identity_ and es_systems supplies per-system _capability_
— two different questions with two different owners
([ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-per-game-disc-selection-in-db-applied-as-bake-time-launch-path-override.md)).

### Selected disc

A user's per-game pick of **which disc launches** for a multi-disc ROM, stored as the disc's **basename** on
`roms.selected_disc` (nullable). It mirrors the per-game **emulator override** exactly: NULL means "follow the default"
(the install's `.m3u` when `file_path` is one, else the first enumerated disc), only `pin_selected_disc` /
`clear_selected_disc` write it, it is **excluded from the sync UPSERT** so a re-sync never resets it, and it anchors on
`roms` so it survives uninstall/reinstall and home migration. Applied as a **bake-time launch-path override** — it
changes only the path baked into the shortcut's `launch_options`, never `RomInstall.file_path`, structurally identical
to how the override changes the invocation without touching `file_path`
([ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-per-game-disc-selection-in-db-applied-as-bake-time-launch-path-override.md)). A stale pin (the
disc no longer present) degrades to the default with a WARNING, never fatal.

### Save-sync slot

A named channel for a ROM's saves (e.g. `default`). **Every slot is a real, addressable name** — the active slot for a
ROM is recorded on its `RomSaveSyncState`, and `default_slot` (a `settings.json` config value, per #822) is the slot a
newly-tracked ROM starts on. Slots let the same ROM carry distinct save sets without clobbering one another. Confirming
a slot (`confirm_slot(...)`) is an explicit user/flow decision that requires a real slot name — the plugin never
silently adopts a foreign slot, and it never confirms a ROM onto the legacy `slot:null`. The legacy `slot:null` is
**retired as a confirmable target** (#1276 / ADR-0017): it survives only as a one-time migration **source** — the Slot
Setup Wizard migrates those pre-slot saves into a named slot — and is never a ROM's active slot.

### Baseline

The last-synced reference point recorded for a tracked save file — captured in a `FileSyncState` value object
(filename + hash + `tracked_save_id`). The newest-wins matrix diffs the current local and remote state against the
baseline to detect drift on the next sync. Adopting a baseline (`adopt_baseline(...)`) is how a file becomes tracked.

### Newest-wins matrix

The save-sync conflict-resolution model (`services/saves/sync_engine/`). For each tracked file it evaluates local vs
remote vs **baseline** and resolves to whichever side is newer, rather than blindly mirroring one direction. The
"matrix" is the per-file evaluation table that drives the actual upload / download / no-op dispatch for a ROM's sync
run.

### SyncRun

One library-sync operation modelled as a first-class aggregate (`domain/sync_run.py`, `sync_runs` table) — a `running` →
`completed` / `cancelled` / `interrupted` / `paused` / `errored` state machine carrying `started_at` / `finished_at`,
the planned platform/ROM counts, and the lists of platforms/collections actually completed. The terminal transition
happens exactly once and is irreversible, and the four stopped terminals are deliberately distinct: `cancelled` is the
user's own Cancel, `interrupted` an external death (the frontend stopped responding), `paused` a deliberate
session-budget stop at a chunk boundary, and `errored` a failure. Replaces the scattered JSON scalars `last_sync`,
`sync_stats`, `last_synced_platforms`, `last_synced_collections`. One row per sync (inserted at apply-start, finalized
at the end). The "how many ROMs" figure is **not** stored on it — that is a live `len(registry)` count computed at read
time.

### Active session

One play session the frontend is currently tracking: `{appId, romId, startMs}` in `sessionManager`'s map, keyed by the
Steam app that opened it. There is one entry **per running app**, not one overall — two RomM games at once are two
active sessions, each finalizing on its own app's exit. An active session is opened by a game-start notification or by
reload-adoption, and its durable counterpart is the `last_session_start` marker on the ROM's `rom_playtime` row plus the
`decky-romm-sync:active-session` breadcrumb that lets a reload adopt it. "Active" is about the frontend's tracking, not
about foreground/focus — a backgrounded game's session is still active.

### Unbind / stale / prune

Three deliberately-distinct ROM-removal notions (see [ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-rom-retention-identity-anchor.md)):

- **Unbind** — drop a ROM's Steam-shortcut binding (`shortcut_app_id` → NULL, via `Rom.unbind_shortcut()`) while keeping
  its `roms` row and all per-ROM state (install, metadata, playtime, saves). What removing a shortcut does.
- **Stale** — a ROM still in local state but no longer returned by RomM on a sync. Triggers an **unbind**, never a
  delete: a stale signal may be a transient server blip or a reversible RomM change, and local playtime/saves must
  survive.
- **Prune** — an explicit, opt-in purge that `DELETE`s the `roms` row, cascading every per-ROM child away atomically.
  The **only** thing that deletes rows. **Clean Up Removed RomM Games** performs it only after fresh exact-ID 404s,
  explicit options, and any enabled recovery bundle have passed their final guards.

### Recovery bundle

A checksum-verified, atomically sealed pre-mutation snapshot created by explicit Prune. It records the affected local
aggregate state and selected/mandatory recoverable files for manual recovery; it is not a database export or an
automatic restore point. Finalization revalidates both the sealed bytes and their source state before deleting anything.

### Action token

A one-run, one-action lease for a frontend-owned Steam operation during Prune. The frontend must claim the exact token
before touching Steam and complete that same token afterward. Duplicate, stale, unknown, and late unclaimed tokens are
non-authoritative and cannot mutate Steam.

### Game-detail store

The single holder of the state one Steam game page shares across its surfaces (`src/utils/gameDetailStore.ts`): the
bound `rom_id`, install state, save-sync status, BIOS level and core selection, plus the reads that produce them. One
entry per appId — the first surface to subscribe opens it, the last to unsubscribe closes it, so a page that is off
screen holds nothing and listens to nothing. The `romm_data_changed` DOM bus keeps carrying the notifications and
carries no state: one handler per appId folds an event into the entry, and every subscriber renders from that one fold
rather than from its own copy. Overlapping reads for one appId share a single request, so a payload-less notification
costs one `get_save_status` round-trip however many surfaces are mounted. The foil to a surface's **own** state — the
play row's PLAYTIME / LAST PLAYED pair, which nothing else reads and which stays in the component.

### Collection kind (Standard / Smart / Virtual)

The axis on which a RomM collection is classified for syncing — the internal literal `standard` / `smart` / `virtual`
(the `enabled_collections` bucket keys, `WorkUnit.collection_kind`, and `CollectionSyncState.collection_kind`), matching
RomM's own UI vocabulary. **Standard** is a manually-created collection (RomM's ownership-carrying kind — its ROM
membership is hand-picked; the auto-managed favorites collection is a Standard one); **Smart** is a saved-search whose
membership resolves at query time; **Virtual** is an ownerless grouping RomM derives from IGDB metadata (franchise /
series). Only Standard and Smart are stampable for the incremental skip. Internal-name history: the first kind was
called `user` until #1539 renamed it `standard` (display "My" → "Standard").

### Collection owner-scope (Mine / All)

The ownership filter over the collection list on a shared RomM server — the `collection_owner_scope` setting valued
`all` (every collection the server lists, including other users' public ones) or `own` (only the signed-in user's own
collections). Orthogonal to the collection kind axis: it filters by owner (`is_own` / `user_id` vs `romm_user_id`), not
by kind, and virtual collections have no owner so they always survive. The stored value stays `own` / `all`; only the
QAM label is **Mine** / **All** (the value was left `own` to avoid a settings migration, #1539).

### Collection naming mode (merge / by_label)

How the Steam-collection **name** is formed when RomM collections share a display name across kinds — the
`collection_naming_mode` setting valued `merge` (default) or `by_label`. Under **`merge`**, same-named collections union
into one `RomM: [<name>] (<host>)` Steam collection (#1503). Under **`by_label`**, each name carries its **fine type
label** so distinct groupings stay separate: `RomM: [<name> (Franchise)]`, `RomM: [<name> (IGDB Collection)]`,
`RomM: [<name> (Smart)]`, `RomM: [<name> (Standard)]`. The label is the fine label, not the coarse kind — franchise and
IGDB-collection are both `kind="virtual"`, distinguished by `virtual_type` (see the **Collection kind** entry above).
Computed backend-side at the reporter's union key (`domain/collection_label.py`), so the wire payload stays name→appIds
and the frontend needs no change; the mode flip is applied by the ordinary complete-set reconcile on the next normal
sync (no Force Full Sync). Same-name-**within-one-label** still unions.

### QAM page / Main / wide page

What the plugin's Quick Access Menu panel shows at one time, chosen by the panel's router (`Page` in
`src/types/navigation.ts`). Exactly one page is mounted at a time; navigating to another unmounts it. **Main** is the
page the panel opens on: notices, status, the Sync button, the download summary and the menu. A **wide page** is a page
that widens the panel from 348 px to 854 px for as long as it is mounted — the full screen width on the Deck, whose Big
Picture viewport is 854 CSS px across. The width belongs to the page, not to a view inside it, and it collapses again
when the page unmounts, the QAM tab changes, the panel closes or the plugin is dismounted. Every page is one or the
other, and the page table in `docs/architecture/qam-panel.md` is where each page's width is decided. _Avoid_: sub-page,
screen, route (a **route** is a Steam page outside the QAM, such as the game detail page).

### List and detail

The layout of a wide page whose entries each carry a detail: the list on the left, the focused entry's detail on the
right. **Focus selects** — moving through the list changes the detail at once; A operates the control in the row (a sync
toggle), never the selection. The two regions scroll independently. _Avoid_: master/detail, sidebar.

### Notice / home

A **notice** is a card at the top of Main naming a condition that needs the user (settings were reset, the RetroArch
input driver is wrong, a sync paused on the session budget). The **home** of a condition is the one page where it is
acted on. A notice names the condition and jumps to its home; the action exists only there, never on the notice. A
condition with no home in the plugin stays a notice without a jump, with Dismiss where there is a sensible end to it.
_Avoid_: banner (component names only), warning, alert.
