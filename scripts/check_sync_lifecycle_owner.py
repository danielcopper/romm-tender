"""Sync-lifecycle owner confinement gate.

The library sync run-lifecycle pair — ``sync_state`` and ``current_sync_id``
on :class:`LibrarySyncStateBox` — is mutated **only** through the box's own
verb methods (``try_begin_run`` / ``request_cancel`` / ``finish_run``). Confining
those two writes to the box keeps run admission, cancellation, and termination
a single compare-and-swap on the one event loop, so a rapid Sync/Cancel can't
leave a half-reset run id (#1202).

This check enforces that confinement: a raw attribute assignment whose target
attribute is exactly ``sync_state`` or ``current_sync_id`` may appear ONLY in
the owner module (``backend/services/library/_state.py``). Any other module
under ``backend/services/library/`` that assigns one of those two fields —
``box.sync_state = ...``, ``self._box.current_sync_id = ...``, etc. — bypasses
the verb-method API and is flagged.

It is an AST attribute-store check, NOT taint/dataflow analysis: it matches the
target attribute name on ``Assign`` / ``AugAssign`` / ``AnnAssign`` (with a
value) nodes. Reads (``ast.Load``) never match. A receiver of any shape is
caught (a plain ``Name`` like ``box`` or a nested ``Attribute`` like
``self._sync_state``), so the common regression — a sub-service flipping the
state field directly — cannot slip through.

Exit 0 when the two fields are written only by the owner, 1 (one line per
offending site) otherwise.
