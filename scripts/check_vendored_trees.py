"""Vendored-tree integrity gate.

Every package under ``backend/_vendor/`` is a copy of code we do not own and
have no source for in this repo — verbatim, or verbatim plus a documented local
patch — pinned by its own ``<pkg>.SHA256SUMS``, so the only thing separating
"the copy we pinned" from "whatever happens to be on disk" is a checksum. A tree
is also large enough that reviewing it as a diff reads as noise, which is exactly
the condition under which a hand-edit or a half-finished re-copy survives review.

The contract is one manifest per tree: ``<pkg>.SHA256SUMS`` beside ``<pkg>/``
pins it, and a package directory with no manifest is a failure. That second half
is what makes the next vendored package guarded by default rather than guarded
if someone remembers — nothing here is named after a package.

What a manifest IS differs per package, and does not change what is asserted:
for a tree taken verbatim from a release it is upstream's own manifest, so the
digests additionally prove identity with the tagged release; for a tree carrying
a deliberate local patch it is our own digest of the patched copy, so they prove
only that nobody has since reached into it. Which kind each one is, is recorded
per package in ``backend/_vendor/README.md``.

Three assertions per tree:

  * every ``<pkg>/…`` entry in the manifest matches the vendored file's digest;
  * the vendored file set EQUALS the manifest's set restricted to ``<pkg>/`` —
    nothing missing, nothing added;
  * the sibling ``<pkg>.LICENSE`` and the manifest's dist-info licence entry
    agree about each other. A wheel's manifest carries such an entry because the
    licence is then vendored BESIDE the tree, which is what keeps the tree
    exactly equal to the manifest; a manifest generated from a tree that holds
    its own licence file carries neither, and the tree digests cover that file
    instead. Having one without the other is reported both ways round: a sibling
    licence no entry pins is checked by nothing, and that is precisely what
    regenerating a wheel's manifest from its tree produces — the dist-info lines
    vanish and the licence assertion disappears with them while the file stays.

The set-equality assertion is why this is a script and not a one-line
``sha256sum -c`` in ``mise.toml``. Neither form of that command works here: a
wheel's manifest carries entries that are never vendored (release artifacts and
the dist-info), so the plain form fails even on a perfect copy, and
``--ignore-missing`` — which is what makes it green again — exits 0 after a
vendored file is deleted, because a deleted file is simply skipped. Digests are
computed here in Python rather than shelled out to ``sha256sum``, whose result
text is localised (a mismatch prints ``FEHLSCHLAG`` on a German machine) —
branching on it would make the gate pass or fail by locale.

``__pycache__`` is ignored wherever it appears, on BOTH sides of the comparison:
it is a build artifact of importing a tree, never part of a manifest, and it is
not committed. Filtering the manifest side too is what keeps the report honest —
a ``__pycache__`` line in a manifest would otherwise be reported as a file
missing from the vendored tree while it sits right there.

Exit 0 when every tree is exactly what its manifest pins, 1 (one line per
discrepancy, plus the re-copy procedure) otherwise.
