"""Lockfile constraint gate.

Each lock below is compiled from the ``.txt`` source beside it via
``uv pip compile`` (``mise run lock-update``). CI and ``mise run setup`` install
from the LOCK, so a bump to a ``.txt`` constraint that does not regenerate the
lock is INERT (the old pin keeps getting installed) and can leave the lock
VIOLATING its source constraint, silently and green — the failure mode behind
#1113 / #1114 / #1115.

This gate asserts that every DIRECT dependency pinned in the lock SATISFIES the
version constraint declared in its ``.txt`` source (and that every source dep is
present in the lock). It deliberately does NOT recompile-and-diff against the
live package index: a fresh ``uv pip compile`` resolves to the newest versions
available *at compile time*, so an unrelated transitive upstream release (or a
different uv index-cache state) would make recompile-and-diff flap red with no
source change. Checking *satisfaction* — not "is it the newest" — targets
exactly the harmful drift and stays deterministic and offline.

Out of scope (not constrained by the source, so not checked): transitive pins
and lock-only orphans.
