# Part of the frontend dev loop (docs/contributing/frontend-dev-loop.md);
# called by the `dev:watch` / `dev:bpm-reset` mise tasks, usable standalone.
#
# Usage:
#   dev_open_bpm.sh [target]        open BPM, place the window on <target>
#   dev_open_bpm.sh --list          print selectable targets, one per line:
#                                   the normalized (lowercase, dash-stripped)
#                                   form of each connected + enabled output,
#                                   plus the "internal" alias while the
#                                   built-in panel is enabled (drives the mise
#                                   tab completion — its prefix filter is
#                                   case-sensitive, so the lowercase forms are
#                                   what complete)
#   dev_open_bpm.sh --resolve [t]   print the output name <t> resolves to and
#                                   exit without side effects (fail-fast guard)
#
# Target resolution — always against the REAL outputs of this machine (no
# hardcoded alias tables: on some Decks the external outputs are DP-2/DP-3,
# not DP-1/DP-2):
#   - "internal" (the default) resolves to the enabled output whose name
#     starts with eDP (the built-in panel).
#   - anything else matches an enabled output name case- and
#     dash-insensitively, so `dp2`, `DP2` and `DP-2` all resolve to `DP-2`.
#   - only connected AND enabled outputs count — KWin can't place a window on
#     a disabled output, so those are neither listed nor resolvable.
#   - an explicit target that matches nothing is a hard error (exit 1, before
#     anything opens); an unresolvable DEFAULT (internal panel disabled or
#     disconnected while docked) only warns, and Big Picture opens without
#     window placement.
#
# Window placement — KWin scripting over DBus (works on X11 and Wayland, no
# extra packages): a short-lived KWin script sweeps the existing windows for
# a caption containing "Big Picture" and watches windowAdded/captionChanged
# for the window when it appears, and moves it to the target output (Plasma 6
# API: workspace.windowList / workspace.sendClientToScreen /
# workspace.screens[].name). It stays live for the newest such window rather
# than for the first one only, because Steam replaces the window it opens (see
# track()). The script is unloaded again after ~120 s so re-runs never
# accumulate. If DBus/KWin scripting is unavailable, the placement degrades to
# a warning and BPM still opens.
