"""Emulate the Deck's Game Mode metrics in the desktop dev loop's Big Picture window.

Part of the frontend dev loop (docs/contributing/frontend-dev-loop.md); driven by the
``dev:ui-scale`` mise task, usable standalone.

Why this exists: the QAM panel gets ~720 CSS px of height in a stock desktop Big Picture
where the Deck's internal panel gives ~454 — the dev loop shows vertical room the device
does not have, so a panel that fits on the desktop can overflow in Game Mode.

The emulation has TWO halves, and forcing the scale alone is NOT enough. The QAM's CSS
height follows::

    QAM CSS height = (Big Picture window PHYSICAL height / scale) - 80

so the scale is only half the equation: a fullscreen 2560x1440 Big Picture forced to 1.5
renders an 880 px QAM — nearly double the Deck's 454 — while reporting the Deck's scale.
This tool therefore ALSO sizes the Big Picture window to the Deck panel's 1280x800
physical pixels, and then HARD-VERIFIES the result against the expected QAM size rather
than claiming metrics it did not achieve.

Half 1 — the scale. The 1.5 is Steam's own per-display "GamepadUI display scale"
(Settings -> Display -> UI Scale), not gamescope and not a Chromium flag. Steam computes
it from the display's resolution + physical size and pushes it into each CEF browser view.
The same two undocumented calls Steam's settings UI uses drive it from here::

    SteamClient.Window.SetGamepadUIAutoDisplayScale(bool)
    SteamClient.Window.SetGamepadUIManualDisplayScaleFactor(float)

Unlike CDP's ``Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`` (which fakes ``devicePixelRatio`` and
leaves the rest of the window unpainted), this is Steam's real scale: the views are
re-laid out and repainted for real.

Half 2 — the window. KWin scripting over DBus (the same loadScript/run/unloadScript route
``dev_open_bpm.sh`` uses for window placement) un-fullscreens the Big Picture window and
sets its geometry so the CLIENT area is exactly 1280x800, on whatever output it already
sits on. ``frameGeometry`` includes decorations, so the frame is corrected by the measured
frame-vs-client delta until the client area lands exactly. The window's prior geometry and
fullscreen state are captured first and restored on exit, alongside the scale.

The scale reaches only the views that are RENDERED when it is pushed. Steam's QuickAccess
view is created with the Big Picture window but laid out lazily, on the first QAM open of
that session: until then it measures 1x1 CSS. A view that renders after the push can come
up UNSCALED — measured at dpr 1, CSS 854x720, i.e. exactly the dev-loop lie this tool
exists to kill — and re-issuing the same two calls while it is live flips it to 1.5 /
854x454 on the spot (also measured). Whether a given view misses the push is not something
the tool can know up front, so the hold is a polling loop rather than a ``signal.pause()``:
it watches the QuickAccess view and re-pushes whenever it finds one rendering at the wrong
dpr, which also covers Steam re-materializing the popup later in the session. An unrendered
QAM is therefore not a failure — it is a not-yet, and it is reported as one (open the QAM
once and the tool verifies it).

DANGER — the forced scale PERSISTS: Steam flushes it to
``~/.local/share/Steam/config/config.vdf`` (``UI -> display -> Current -> ScaleFactor``)
within a couple of seconds. A factor left forced is a factor Steam keeps.

The setting is PER DISPLAY, keyed by Steam's display identity (``strDisplayName``, e.g.
``External: DP-2 27"|||Fullscreen-2560x1440``), and ``config.vdf`` carries one entry per
identity. So the blast radius depends on where the Big Picture window sits: on the Deck's
internal panel the identity is the one Game Mode itself uses and a forced factor bleeds
straight into Game Mode; on an external monitor it writes that monitor's entry and leaves
Game Mode's alone. The tool prints the identity it is scaling, so this is never a guess.

So the exit path CAPTURES the prior state before applying anything and puts back exactly
that (SIGINT/SIGTERM/finally): auto stays auto, and a manual UI Scale — an accessibility
"Larger text" value, say — is re-set to its old factor rather than silently flipped to
auto, which would destroy the user's setting. Only a hard SIGKILL can skip the restore;
``dev:ui-scale auto`` is the rescue path for exactly that case, and it is the one mode
that forces auto ON unconditionally (it has no captured state to honour).

The prior state is read from Steam's LIVE settings store (``window.settingsStore.settings``
in SharedJSContext — the same state Steam's own Display settings page renders), not from
``config.vdf``, and the restore is verified against it plus the live ``devicePixelRatio``.
``config.vdf`` is only a fallback source, because it is measurably unreliable in-session:
Steam re-flushes ``ScaleFactor`` within seconds but leaves ``AutoScaleFactor`` alone (it
stayed ``1`` on-device while a manual factor was applied and rendering), so the file can
report a manual scale as automatic — and restoring "automatic" to a user who is on a
manual scale is exactly the setting-destroying bug this capture exists to prevent.

Transport: the CEF remote-debugging endpoint on ``localhost:8080`` (a Decky platform
invariant — Decky Loader itself requires CEF debugging enabled). ``GET /json`` lists the
debuggable targets; ``SharedJSContext`` is where ``SteamClient`` lives, and the
``Big-Picture-*`` / ``QuickAccess_*`` page targets are the two views we measure.

The RFC 6455 client below is a deliberate copy of the one in
``py_modules/adapters/renderer_gc.py`` rather than a shared import: that adapter is
shipped plugin code with a fail-open, single-command, payload-discarding contract, while
this dev tool needs the evaluate *result*, several commands per run, and loud failures.
Sharing would mean either widening the shipped adapter's contract for a dev-only need or
adding a generic client to shipped ``lib/`` that no production path uses (it would land in
the release zip and in Sonar's scope). RFC 6455 is frozen; these ~80 lines don't drift.

Emulates the Deck by BOTH sizing the Big Picture window to the panel's 1280x800 physical
pixels AND forcing Steam's GamepadUI display scale — the QAM's CSS height is
(window physical height / scale) - 80, so neither half works alone. The result is then
verified against what the Deck would render, and a miss is reported as a failure.

  deck      (default) force 1.5 — the Deck internal panel's auto scale, i.e. exact
            Game Mode metrics (QAM 854x454).
  <factor>  force a bare number. 2.0-2.4 = a user on "Larger text" (worst case: least
            vertical room), ~1.28 = docked 1080p, ~1.71 = docked 1440p.
  steam     adopt the UI Scale the user currently has set in Steam (config.vdf); falls
            back to 1.5 when Steam is on automatic scaling.
  auto|off  UNCONDITIONALLY re-enable Steam's automatic scaling and exit. This is the
            rescue path for when a previous run was SIGKILLed and its captured state
            died with it — it does NOT know what you were on, it just forces auto (and
            it does not touch the window; resize it by hand).

The forcing modes hold until Ctrl-C, then restore what you were on BEFORE the run: auto
stays auto, a manual UI Scale (e.g. an accessibility "Larger text" value) is put back
exactly as it was rather than silently flipped to auto, and the Big Picture window goes
back to the geometry and fullscreen state it had."""
