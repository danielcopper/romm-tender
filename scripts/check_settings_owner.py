"""Settings-owner confinement gate.

``settings.json`` is written crash-safe by a single owner — the persistence
adapter (``adapters/persistence.py``: write-tmp → fsync → ``os.replace`` →
fsync-dir, plus corrupt-file quarantine). If any other module names the file by
its literal filename, that module could read or write it directly, bypassing the
crash-safe path and the version-stamping/quarantine invariants the owner holds.

This check enforces a **proxy** for "all writes go through the owner": the
string literal ``"settings.json"`` may appear ONLY in the owner module.
Confining the filename literal to the owner means no other module can name —
hence open or write — the file. This is name-confinement, NOT taint/dataflow
analysis: it cannot catch a module that receives an already-constructed path
from the owner and writes to it. It catches the common regression, which is a
second module hardcoding the filename and writing its own copy.

It scans every backend ``.py`` (all of ``backend/`` except ``_vendor/`` and
except the owner) via ``ast`` and flags any ``ast.Constant`` whose value is
exactly the str ``"settings.json"``. A docstring or comment that
merely *mentions* settings.json in prose does not match — only an exact
string-constant ``"settings.json"`` does (a docstring's constant value is the
whole docstring text, not the bare filename). ``tests/`` is not scanned: tests
legitimately reference the filename.

Exit 0 when the literal is confined to the owner, 1 (one line per offending
site) otherwise.
