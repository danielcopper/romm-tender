"""Aggregate field-assignment ban — Cosmic Python enforcement.

Aggregate roots in ``backend/domain/`` decorated with ``@cosmic_aggregate``
expose mutation only through verb-named methods on the root. External code
must NOT do ``aggregate.field = value`` — that bypasses the aggregate's
invariants. This check scans ``backend/services/`` for such patterns and
fails CI if any are found.

Heuristic (conservative by design):

  1. Parse every file under ``backend/domain/``; collect the class names
     decorated with ``@cosmic_aggregate`` (or attribute paths ending in
     ``cosmic_aggregate``). Build a lowercase-name set.
  2. Parse every file under ``backend/services/``; flag every ``Assign``
     node whose target is an ``Attribute`` on a plain ``Name`` whose name
     (case-insensitively) exactly equals the snake_case form of one of the
     aggregate names (variable ``rom`` matches aggregate ``Rom``; ``rom_state``
     does not). Skip ``self.x = ...`` and ``some[key].x = ...`` — those are
     method-body internals and subscript-receiver patterns, not aggregate-field
     assignments.

The heuristic can produce both false positives (variable named ``rom``
holding something else) and false negatives (assignment via complex
expressions like ``service.get_rom().field = ...``). It is a guardrail,
not a prover. The escape hatch is a trailing comment on the same line:

    rom.cover_path = path  # pragma: no aggregate-check

Aggregates that don't carry the decorator (e.g. old JSON-era containers
like ``SaveSyncState``) are NOT flagged — old code keeps working until
the SQLite cutover wave replaces them.

Exit 0 on no findings, exit 1 if any findings (one line per finding).
