"""Generates the plugin mark: a button diamond ringed by a pair of sync arrows,
set in a disc and split along a facet.

Everything is driven by two small config objects — a `Palette` (colours) and a
`Geometry` (positions and sizes) — so the mark can be re-derived and nudged
without touching the drawing code. A `Palette` carries two facet pairs: the disc
tones and the "ink" tones (arrows + button bars), each given as (above-left,
below-right) for the split, plus the two warm dot colours. Most of the work is in
the blue pairs; the dots only move when the ink moves far enough that they have
to follow it.

The four dots sit on a diamond that is **wider than it is tall** — a stretched
one, not a square. That stretch is what tilts the bars joining adjacent dots past
45°, to 141.6°, and the facet follows the bars, so the seam and the bars share one
angle. Squaring the diamond (`cap_stagger` to 0, `dot_along` to half of `cap_sep`)
would pull both back to 45° together.

Many of the constants below carry more precision than a hand-picked number would.
They are that specific because they reproduce the artwork this mark comes from;
treat them as a reference rather than as preferences, and where one is
deliberately off that reference the field says so.

The body is drawn as four bars, each running from a hub out past one dot. At rest
the two hubs sit either side of the seam, so each pair of collinear bars merges
into one capsule. Pull the hubs to the centre (`morph` -> 1) and the same four
bars become a D-pad cross — that is the whole shape animation, and it is why
there is only one body routine rather than two. Only a bar's outer corners are
rounded, and by how much depends on the morph: a capsule wants the full
semicircle, a D-pad's arms want ends much closer to square.

# enough to carry them — on light ink they fall to 1.1:1 and vanish, which is why
# inverting the mark is not an option. The arrows meanwhile need the disc to stay
# lighter than the ink, and dropping the disc alone runs out at about #5b7896,
# where they fall to 1.65:1 against it. So a darker mark moves the disc and the
