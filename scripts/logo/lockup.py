"""The banner lockup: the mark with TENDER set beneath it.

The wordmark ships as an outline, not as text — `wordmark.path` holds the cut
glyphs and `wordmark.json` their metrics. Rendering therefore needs neither the
typeface nor fontTools; only re-cutting does, via `--cut`.

    lockup.py                 write both variants to out/
    lockup.py --cut           re-cut the outline from the typeface, then write

Two variants ship because one cannot serve both grounds: the mark's ink
disappears on GitHub's dark canvas, so the dark variant sets the wordmark in the
disc's blue instead. The README picks between them with `<picture>` and
`prefers-color-scheme`.

Versals are for the banner alone. Everywhere the name appears as text —
Tender's display name, the QAM header, toasts, prose — it is `Tender`.
