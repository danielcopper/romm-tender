"""Frontend↔backend callable-manifest parity gate.

The Decky callable surface is declared twice: once on the frontend as
``callable<[Args], Return>("wire_name")`` (TypeScript) and once on the backend
as a public ``async def`` method on the ``Plugin`` class in ``main.py``. Nothing
ties the two together at build time — a renamed/added/removed callable on either
side, or an arg-count change that the other side doesn't follow, only surfaces as
a runtime "method not found" / wrong-arity failure once the plugin is loaded.

This check derives both surfaces from source and fails when they diverge, so the
wire stays one source of truth. It is the static sibling of the
``tests/contract/`` tier: the contract tests drive the *real* callables
frontend-shaped; this gate pins that the two *declarations* agree before any
callable is driven.

What it guarantees (and what it deliberately does not):

  * Every frontend ``callable("name")`` has a matching backend ``async def name``
    and vice versa — no orphan on either side.
  * Where a name exists on both sides, the **arity** (positional parameter count,
    ``self`` dropped on the backend) matches. Python method signatures carry no
    type hints, so arity is the only mechanically checkable shape — arg TYPES are
    out of scope (the contract tier exercises those by driving real values).
  * A backend method that takes ``*args`` has a variable arity; its name is still
    checked, but the arity comparison is skipped for it.

``EXEMPT`` holds wire names deliberately kept out of the parity check. It is
empty today; an entry here is a conscious "this name is intentionally declared on
only one side" decision — never a lever to silence a real drift. A genuine drift
is a finding to triage, not to exempt.

Exit 0 when the two surfaces match, 1 (one line per discrepancy) otherwise.
