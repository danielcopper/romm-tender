"""404-vs-unreachable gate — exception-type-blind classification enforcement.

RomM answers a request for an entity it no longer has with HTTP 404. That is
the server *answering*, not the server being unreachable, so it must reach the
frontend as ``not_found`` — never as ``server_unreachable``. The plugin already
owns the funnel that decides this (:func:`lib.errors.classify_error`, which maps
``RommNotFoundError`` to :data:`ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND`); the recurring defect is a
catch-all ``except Exception`` that ignores the funnel and hardcodes the
unreachable verdict for every exception it sees. The whole UI then claims "RomM
offline" while the server is plainly answering.

This class of bug was swept once before (#971) and came back, because
``check_failure_shape.py`` inspects key *presence* only — a hardcoded
``server_unreachable`` is a perfectly canonical failure shape, so every one of
these sites is green there. This check inspects the slug *choice* instead.

The rule
========

Inside ``backend/services/``, a **catch-all** exception handler (``except
Exception``, ``except BaseException``, or a bare ``except:``) may not *return* a
hardcoded ``server_unreachable`` verdict. A handler returns one when a dict
literal in its body binds a verdict key — ``reason``, ``status``, or
``recommended_action`` — to ``ErrorCode.SERVER_UNREACHABLE`` or to the bare
``"server_unreachable"`` string. Both spellings count: the canonical failure
shape uses the enum, while the discriminated-status and ``recommended_action``
carve-outs spell the slug out as a literal.

Binding the key to a *name* (``{"reason": reason}`` after ``reason, message =
classify_error(e)``) is the correct shape and is what this check is steering
towards, so it is never flagged. Keying on the verdict's position — rather than
on the mere mention of the slug anywhere in the handler — is deliberate: it
catches the sharpest form of this bug, a handler that calls ``classify_error``
and then **discards** its verdict in favour of the hardcoded one, which a
"does the handler call the funnel?" test would wave through.

One escape clears an otherwise-flagged handler:

* **A sibling handler peels the 404 off first** — the same ``try`` carries an
  ``except RommNotFoundError`` clause, so the definitive-404 case never reaches
  the catch-all. This is the shape the partial-success carve-outs use, where the
  verdict is a flag rather than a ``reason`` slug and there is no funnel to call.

``EXEMPT`` holds service modules deliberately kept out of the scan — a module
that does not talk to RomM at all, so ``classify_error`` (a RomM-shaped funnel)
has nothing to say about its failures. Adding to it is a deliberate act that
shows up in review.

Two modes:

  * report (default) — print every catch-all handler carrying an unreachable
    verdict, grouped by verdict, then exit 0. Report mode never fails; it is the
    inventory.
  * ``--check`` — enforce mode. Exit 1 on any violation.

A **typed** handler is never flagged. ``except RommConnectionError`` or
``except SaveSyncTimeoutError`` returning ``server_unreachable`` is a deliberate
statement about a known exception type, which is exactly what this check wants
more of.

The AST heuristic is intentionally conservative, and a guardrail rather than a
prover: it reads one ``try`` statement at a time and does not follow a verdict
returned by a helper the handler calls, nor one assembled across statements
(``resp = {...}; resp["reason"] = ...``). A ``try`` nested *inside* a handler is
scanned as its own statement, with its own sibling-peel check, and its dict
literals are NOT attributed to the enclosing handler — otherwise a nested peel
would read as an unpeeled verdict on the outer one and false-positive.
