"""urlopen choke-point gate for the RomM HTTP transport.

``RommHttpAdapter`` remembers one bit of transport state — whether the RomM
server is known unreachable — and every ladder consults it: while it is set,
each retry ladder runs a single attempt with no backoff. The bit is cleared in
exactly one place, ``RommHttpAdapter._urlopen``, so that a response arriving on
ANY path clears it, the paths that deliberately skip ``with_retry`` included
(the reachability probe and the heartbeat run through ``request_once``).

A request method that reaches ``urllib.request.urlopen`` on its own therefore
never clears the bit. Nothing about that fails: the call succeeds, the tests
pass, and the plugin simply stays in its degraded single-attempt mode until some
other path happens to succeed. That is the regression this gate exists to catch.

It enforces a **structural** rule: inside ``backend/adapters/romm/http.py``,
a call to ``urllib.request.urlopen`` may appear only in the body of
``RommHttpAdapter._urlopen``. It is an AST check over call sites, NOT dataflow
analysis: it cannot catch an alias (``opener = urllib.request.urlopen``) or a
call reached through ``getattr``. It catches the regression that actually
happens, which is a new request method copying the ``urlopen(...)`` line from a
sibling.

Other modules are out of scope — the rule is about this adapter's own state, and
another adapter opening a URL says nothing about RomM's reachability.

Exit 0 when the choke point holds, 1 (one line per offending site) otherwise.
