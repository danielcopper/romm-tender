"""UoW-seam nesting ban — what may not be called while a Unit of Work is open.

A Unit of Work opens a SQLite transaction with ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` on its own
connection. That single fact carries two separate rules, and this check
enforces both from one AST walk because the matcher is identical — only the
seam list and the failure message differ.

**Rule 1 — a seam that opens its own UoW deadlocks.** The write lock is not
re-entrant. Calling a seam that opens its OWN UoW while a UoW is already open
on the same path blocks on the nested ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` until
``busy_timeout`` (~5s) elapses, then raises ``database is locked``.
``FakeUnitOfWork`` in the unit tests shares no real connection, so the deadlock
is invisible there — it only surfaces on a real device. The hazard has bitten
four sites across three issues (#1047, #1134 twice, and the migration site
fixed via #1155). The seams live in :data:`SEAM_METHODS`.

**Rule 2 — a seam that touches the disk holds the write lock across the I/O.**
``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` takes the write lock at the top of the block, so **even a
read-only UoW is a writer**. The database runs in WAL, so readers are
unaffected; any other *writer* that arrives waits on the lock for up to
``busy_timeout=5000`` and fails with ``SQLITE_BUSY`` only if it is still held
then. A directory walk or a config parse held inside a UoW therefore stalls
those writers for as long as the I/O takes. CONTEXT.md's Unit of Work entry and
ADR-0006 state the rule — a transaction wraps database reads and writes, never
file or server I/O — and until #1779 nothing detected a breach: six call sites
had drifted across it, because nothing at a call site reveals that an injected
seam touches the disk. The seams live in
:data:`IO_SEAM_METHODS`. Both the rule and this check come from reading the
code; nothing here rests on a measurement of how long any of those
transactions actually held the lock.

The established fix is the same for both: snapshot the rows a seam needs
*inside* one short UoW, close it, then call the seam *outside* any open UoW
(``services/relaunch_options_resolver.py``, ``services/cores.py``,
``services/disc.py``, ``services/downloads.py``,
``services/library/shortcut_launch_resolver.py`` are the reference shape).
Re-read anything the write then depends on: the second transaction runs on its
own connection, so the snapshot may have gone stale.

This check walks ``py_modules/services/`` and fails when either family's method
is called lexically inside an open ``with <...>uow_factory() as uow:`` block.
The two seam lists and the bare-factory open (:data:`UOW_FACTORY_SUFFIX`, which
catches a nested open under rule 1) live at the top of the file, so registering
a future seam is a one-line addition.

What the matcher cannot see
---------------------------
It is lexical and conservative (a guardrail, not a prover), and these blind
spots apply to **both** families:

* It only sees calls nested inside a ``with`` block in the same function scope
  — a seam reached through a helper called from inside the UoW is not caught,
  and a nested ``def``/``lambda`` resets the scope (a helper *defined* inside a
  UoW but *called* elsewhere is not flagged).
* It matches on surface syntax: aliasing a seam to a local
  (``fn = resolver.active_core_for_rom; fn(rom_id)``) or holding the UoW
  factory under an attribute whose name does not end in ``uow_factory`` slips
  past the name match.
* It classifies a call by its own ``func``, so a seam **passed as a bound
  method** is invisible — ``run_in_executor(None, resolver.enumerate_discs,
  install)`` inside a UoW is an attribute, not a call, and is not flagged. That
  matters more than the shape suggests: ``run_in_executor`` is how
  ``services/disc.py`` and ``services/cores.py`` reach their ``_io`` bodies in
  the first place. ``scripts/check_read_only_module.py`` records the same shape
  for its own gate.
* Both seam lists are hand-maintained. A seam whose implementation *grows* a
  UoW open or a file read later is not detected until someone adds its name.

One blind spot is **shared by both families, and only one of them closes it**.
A seam injected as a call-shaped Protocol (``__call__``, no method name of its
own) has no method name to match: the consumer writes
``self._candidate_probe(...)``, never the seam's own name. Rule 1 leaves it
open — the ``current_save_sorting`` / ``has_adoption_candidate`` entries guard
only call sites that name the method, which is the owning service's own and any
peer holding the object rather than the bound method. Rule 2's five
call-shaped seams are closed the cheap way instead: every consumer in
``services/`` binds each to one attribute — ``self._resolve_system``,
``self._sandbox_launcher``, ``self._system_extensions``, ``self._system_known``,
``self._firmware_folder_verdicts`` — and those attribute names are what the
list carries (``resolve_system`` and ``resolve_sandbox_launcher`` are listed
beside theirs, being the implementations' real method names,
``RommHttpAdapter.resolve_system`` and
``EsFindRulesAdapter.resolve_sandbox_launcher``, for a peer holding the object;
the other three have no such twin). That is a convention, not a guarantee — a
consumer binding one under a different attribute slips past, and it only works
while the attribute name means one thing. Doing the same for rule 1 means a
second list of holding attributes to keep in step, and is not built.

Conversely, matching only *attribute* calls is what keeps the ``enumerate_discs``
entry safe: the pure ``domain.disc_selection.enumerate_discs`` does no I/O of
its own, and its one consumer imports it bare. Written dotted it *would* be
flagged — the safety is in the call site's bare import, not in the name.

Seams considered and left out
-----------------------------
These were weighed for :data:`IO_SEAM_METHODS` and kept out. It is a record of
two decisions, not a survey of what touches the disk. Neither is exempt from the
rule — a UoW held across either is a breach — and the reason is not that their
I/O matters less:

* ``DirectoryFileListerFn`` — a directory listing, and its consumer binds it to
  ``self._list_files``. Its call-shaped siblings are *in* the list, matched by
  the attribute they are bound to, so the mechanism plainly reaches this shape;
  what stops this one is the name. ``_list_files`` says nothing about which seam
  it holds — any class might bind it to something unrelated — so an entry would
  key the gate on a coincidence, where ``_system_extensions`` and
  ``_resolve_system`` each mean one thing.
* ``RetroDeckPaths``'s path getters sit behind a 30-second TTL cache
  (``adapters/retrodeck_paths.py``), so a call is usually a dict lookup and a
  ban would fire mostly where nothing is spent — which teaches writers to reach
  for a pragma instead of looking. The caveat is that only a successfully-read
  config is ever cached, and the TTL guard tests the cached value first, so on a
  machine without RetroDECK every getter reopens.

The escape hatch is a trailing comment on the seam-call line:

    self._active_core.active_core_for_rom(rom_id)  # pragma: no uow-check

**One pragma covers both families,** because it suppresses the *line*, not a
named rule — so a line naming more than one seam, such as
``get_emulator_options(self._resolve_system(slug))``, is silenced by the single
comment on it. A rule-named spelling would only ask the writer to restate what
the failure message already told them.

Exit 0 on no findings, exit 1 if any findings (one line per finding).
