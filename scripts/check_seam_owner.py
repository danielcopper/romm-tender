"""Seam-owner confinement gate for the library sync package.

``backend/services/library/`` is a decomposition: each module owns one job,
and a job's injected seams are what identify it. When a seam leaks into a second
module the decomposition quietly reverses — the module that "does not do that
any more" grows a second reason to open the same resource, and the boundary the
split was for stops being checkable by reading one file.

Three confinements are enforced here, each recording a promise a module
docstring already makes:

* ``active_core`` / ``disc_resolver`` belong to ``shortcut_launch_resolver.py``.
  They are the only reason the sync ever resolves a ROM's emulator or its
  disc-pinned launch path, and holding them in one module is what keeps the
  per-ROM UoW the ``active_core`` seam opens out of the read UoW the
  install-path scan holds (:mod:`services.library.shortcut_launch_resolver`).
* ``renderer_rss`` / ``renderer_gc`` belong to ``session_budget.py``. Its
  contract is that no renderer-RSS **reading** is taken anywhere else in the
  package — every other budget site prices against a reading that module handed
  it (:mod:`services.library.session_budget`).
* ``artwork`` belongs to ``cover_preparer.py`` **and** ``reporter.py``, and to
  nothing else. The pair is the point: the preparer asks the artwork service for
  a unit's covers on the apply path, the reporter asks it to finalise a cover
  path at each chunk's commit, and those are the only two moments a sync run has
  an artwork question. A **two**-owner entry is weaker than a one-owner entry and
  is not a licence to add a third — the seam was held in three modules until the
  orchestrator's cover work moved out, and this entry is what stops it drifting
  back (:mod:`services.library.cover_preparer`).

The scan is AST-shaped and covers the two ways a module takes hold of a seam:

* an **attribute** named after the seam's config attribute, read or written
  (``config.active_core``, and any other receiver — the names are distinctive,
  so this cannot be dodged by renaming the holding object), and
* an **annotation** naming the seam's Protocol type (``ActiveCoreReader``,
  ``RendererRssFn``, …) on a dataclass field, a parameter, or a return.

**A composition root may pass a seam on; it may not use one.** The façade takes
all four from ``bootstrap`` and hands each to the sub-service that owns it, so
two shapes are allowed everywhere rather than one file being exempted wholesale:
a seam attribute that *is* a call's keyword-argument value
(``ShortcutLaunchResolverConfig(active_core=config.active_core)`` — handed on,
not held) and a seam annotation on a field of :data:`FACADE_CONFIG_CLASS`, the
one class ``bootstrap`` delivers into. A façade method that *reaches through*
the seam (``self._config.active_core.active_emulator_for_rom(...)``) is neither,
and is a finding — which a blanket file exemption could not tell from wiring.

It is a surface-syntax guardrail, not dataflow analysis. What it cannot see:

* a seam aliased to a differently-named attribute or local, or reached through
  ``getattr``;
* a seam passed positionally into a helper that then holds it;
* a quoted (string) annotation, which is a ``Constant`` and never a type name;
* a Protocol imported under an alias
  (``from services.protocols import ActiveCoreReader as CoreReader``), which
  leaves the annotation leaf unmatched — the aliasing this catches is of the
  *value*, not of the *type*;
* the field **name** in a foreign config, which is never inspected — so
  ``active_core: CoreReader`` combines the previous two and is invisible on both
  halves of the scan.

The last two are precision in the documented reach rather than a way through:
whatever the field is called and however its type was imported, the constructor
that unpacks it reads ``config.<seam>`` outside a keyword argument, and that
read is flagged. What actually stays on review is a seam reached without ever
naming it.

Exit 0 when every seam is held only by its owner, 1 (one line per offending
site) otherwise.
