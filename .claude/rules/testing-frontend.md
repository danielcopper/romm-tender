# Frontend component tests — `@decky/api` event harness

Run with `mise run test:frontend` (Vitest + happy-dom); `mise run test:frontend:coverage` for coverage.

`frontend/src/test-utils/decky-api-mock.ts` exposes an in-memory event bus that `addEventListener` /
`removeEventListener` route through. Tests dispatch backend events via `emitDeckyEvent` instead of mocking `@decky/api`
per file; `frontend/src/bigpicture/CustomPlayButton.test.tsx` is the reference shape. The bus resets between tests; use
`deckyEventListenerCount(name)` to assert `useEffect` cleanup ran. DOM-level `globalThis.dispatchEvent` flows bypass the
harness — happy-dom handles them natively. Prefer the harness over extracting listener bodies into
`frontend/src/utils/*.ts` purely for testability.

**Catch coverage assertions must be non-vacuous.** A test claiming `.catch` coverage MUST assert the post-catch state —
the fallback return value, the toast body, the `debugLog` message, the surfaced status. Asserting only that the
rejecting call was invoked is vacuous: it passes with or without the `.catch`.
